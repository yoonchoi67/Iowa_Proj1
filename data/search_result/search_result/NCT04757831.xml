    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study with a primary objective of determining the&#xD;
      incidence of non-severe and severe COVID-19, including MIS-C, among eligible children who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with COVID-19 and consent (or assent) to collection of data on risk factors using a&#xD;
      unique direct-to-participant, direct-to-family, and direct-to-community approach. Secondary&#xD;
      and exploratory objectives include risk factors of severe disease and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;

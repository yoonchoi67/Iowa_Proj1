  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734™) reduces&#xD;
      the composite risk of death or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) through Day 29 in&#xD;
      participants with severely reduced kidney function who are hospitalized for coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

    <description>The composite of all-cause mortality or IMV is the combined endpoint of the percentage of participants who die or initiate on IMV through Day 29.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>All-Cause Mortality Through Day 29</measure>

    <measure>Time to Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose date up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Time to recovery is the time from first dose to recovery. Recovery is defined as the first day on which the participant satisfies one of the following three categories from the 8-point ordinal scale: 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care (other than per-protocol RDV/saline as placebo administration).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Status Assessed by an 8-Point Ordinal Scale on Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical status is derived from death, hospital discharge, and the ordinal scale. Each day, the worst (highest) score from the previous day will be recorded. The Ordinal scale is as follows: 1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care (other than per-protocol RDV/saline as placebo administration); 4. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care for COVID-19-specific medical care (other than per-protocol RDV administration); 5. Hospitalized, supplemental oxygen; 6. Hospitalized, on noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices; 7. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and 8. Death. Higher scores indicate worst clinical status.</description>

      The aim of our study is to determine to what extent university students' physical activities&#xD;
      are affected by staying at home during the pandemia considering that they spend hours working&#xD;
      by a computer. The state of physical inactivities will be questioned by an online survey for&#xD;
      Inernational Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form). Then average energy expenditure&#xD;
      following stepping and/or exercise will be asked from health application of mobile phones.&#xD;

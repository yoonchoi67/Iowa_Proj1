  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the literature, it seems likely that a nutritional intervention with nicotinamide (a&#xD;
      form of vitamin B3) can support the therapy of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) by, e.g., improving the availability of&#xD;
      tryptophan and its metabolism-supporting metabolites (e.g. NAD). A pilot phase of the COVit&#xD;
      trial showed an effect of nicotinamide on the time to complete resolution of COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms. In addition, diarrhoea is a common symptom of COVID-19. Therefore, in a second part&#xD;
      of the study, 420 symptomatic patients each with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are to take&#xD;
      1,000 mg nicotinamide (500 mg conventional nicotinamide and 500 mg nicotinamide released in a&#xD;
      controlled manner in the intestine) or corresponding placebos per day in a blinded fashion&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial is the frequency of complete symptom&#xD;
      resolution after 2 weeks of supplementation; secondary endpoints are the frequency of&#xD;
      complete symptom resolution after 4 weeks of supplementation, the time from diagnosis to&#xD;
      symptom resolution, the frequency of freedom from fatigue after 2 weeks of supplementation,&#xD;
      and a development of severe COVID-19 (examination in an emergency department, hospitalisation&#xD;
      with at least 24 hours of oxygen requirement, intensive care requirement, ventilator&#xD;
      requirement or death). Patients will be approached and informed after positive testing and&#xD;
      can give their informed consent for participation via a website. After randomised&#xD;
      distribution of the trial supplements, patients will be interviewed by telephone about their&#xD;
      disease course at baseline (week 0) and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks with a follow-up contact after&#xD;
      approximately 6 months. Stool and urine samples will be collected from approximately 20&#xD;
      selected patients at week 0, week 1/2, week 4, week 6 and after 6 months. In addition to&#xD;
      blood count and standard blood profile, various inflammatory markers and the metabolome, in&#xD;
      particular tryptophan metabolism, will be examined in the blood. In these patients, the viral&#xD;
      strain will also be determined by sequencing from nasopharyngeal swabs. In the stool, changes&#xD;
      in the microbiome (in 100 patients) as well as metagenome and metabolome (in 20-30 patients)&#xD;
      will be analysed. The study is expected to produce rapid results on whether nicotinamide&#xD;
      supplementation can alleviate the disease course of COVID-19.&#xD;

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 coronavirus has led to a global pandemic of respiratory diseases with an&#xD;
      increase in hospitalization and death risk. To keep COVID-19 manageable for healthcare, early&#xD;
      treatment is urgently needed to avoid hospitalization. Dexamethasone can dampen the&#xD;
      exaggerated cytokine response to COVID-19 and is a promising agent for preventing disease&#xD;
      aggravation, hospitalization and death. However, the evidence on the effectiveness, safety&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of dexamethasone treatment in primary care is inconclusive.&#xD;

&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        - SpO2&lt;92% (&lt;90% for COPD patients) in rest with GP's and patient's shared decision to keep&#xD;
        patient at home despite this in itself being an indication for referral to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

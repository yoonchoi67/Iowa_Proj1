    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is causing many deaths around the world, putting a strain on health&#xD;
      services. Patients with pre-existing chronic conditions are most affected by the SARS-COV2&#xD;
      infection. Infectious complications are a common cause of mortality and one of the main&#xD;
      causes of morbidity in all these diseases. The main objective of this project is the&#xD;
      assessment of patients with thalassemia, drepanocytosis, other haemoglobinopathies and rares&#xD;
      inherited anemias suffering from SARS-COV-2 to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain clinical and epidemiological data that can provide information on a possible&#xD;
           increased vulnerability of these patients to SARS-COV-2 infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sharing therapeutic approaches considering the lack of information about the treatment.&#xD;

      The COVID-19 pandemic is causing many deaths around the world, putting a strain on health&#xD;
      services. Patients with pre-existing chronic diseases are most affected by SARS-COV2&#xD;
      infection. Italy is one of the countries most involved. Thalassaemia, drepanocytosis, other&#xD;
      hemoglobinopathies and inherited anemias are widespread in italy and the mediterranean area.&#xD;
      Thalassaemia syndromes are characterized by different clinical forms with mutations in globin&#xD;
      genes that cause the reduction or complete absence of synthesis of the globin chain.&#xD;
      Transfusion therapy remains the basis of thalassaemia management. Based on the extent of the&#xD;
      severity of anemia and clinical presentation, thalassaemia was classified as&#xD;
      transfusion-dependent (TDT) and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT). Transfusion inevitably&#xD;
      contributes to iron overload, which is associated with secondary morbidity, including organ&#xD;
      damage, especially heart, liver, bone tissue, and endocrine glands. In ntdt, comorbility is&#xD;
      mainly related to chronic anemia and increased gastrointestinal iron adsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other inherited anaemias include a large group of pathologies such as: hyporegenerative&#xD;
      anaemias, such as congenital diseritropoietic anaemia and diamond-blackfan anemia; anaemies&#xD;
      from deficiency of red blood cell membrane proteins due to altered membrane structure, such&#xD;
      as hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary ellipsocytosis, and impaired membrane transport&#xD;
      function, such as hereditary stomatocytosis; anaemies due to enzymatic deficiency, the most&#xD;
      frequent of which are pyruvate deficiency kinase and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase;&#xD;
      sideroblastic anaemias and all other hereditary microcytic anaemies such as irida. All these&#xD;
      anemias are characterized by high phenotypic heterogeneity but in most cases chronic&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia, iron overload and addiction transfusion are found (as a percentage of a&#xD;
      variable of cases). Transfusion therapy remains the basis of the management of these anaemias&#xD;
      along with splenectomy (not practicable in all these classes of anemia). As with thalassaemia&#xD;
      syndromes, in such anaemias, we find secondary morbidity, such as heart, liver, and endocrine&#xD;
      damage resulting from both chronic anemia and iron overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infectious complications are a common cause of mortality and one of the main causes of&#xD;
      morbidity in all these pathologies. The greater quantitative and functional quantities, the&#xD;
      involve t and b lymphocytes, production of immunoglobulins, neutrophils and macrophages,&#xD;
      chemotaxis and phagocytosis, as well as the complement system. Excess iron can alter the&#xD;
      immune balance in favour of the growth of infectious organisms. Other factors include&#xD;
      multiple transfusions, associated with constant allo-antigenic stimulation. A large&#xD;
      percentage of adult patients are splenectomized and risk complications related to splenectomy&#xD;
      such as capsuled bacterial infections and immune system changes; low levels of zinc, another&#xD;
      immune regulator; iron chelation therapy, which predisposes to serious yersinia-like&#xD;
      infections. The circulation of abnormal erythrocytes is the cause of another permanent immune&#xD;
      stimulus. In addition, particularly in elderly patients, the coexistence of adrenal&#xD;
      hypofunction makes the response to sepsis less effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, we have no information on the vulnerability of patients with thalassaemia,&#xD;
      drepanocytosis, other hemoglobinopathies and hereditary anemias to SARS-COV2 infection. In&#xD;
      order to obtain more information useful to increase our knowledge, a retrospective survey has&#xD;
      been planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is the evaluation of patients with thalassaemia,&#xD;
      drepanocytosis, other hereditary hemoglobinopathies and anaemias affected by SARS-COV2 to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. obtain clinical and epidemiological data that may dare information on a possible&#xD;
           increased vulnerability of these patients to SARS-COV2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. share therapeutic approaches considering the lack of information about treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an italian study of observational, pharmacological, non-interventional,&#xD;
      retrospective, prospective and multicenter, non-profit cohort. Patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      thalassaemia, drepanocytosis, other hemoglobinopathies and hereditary anaemia positive to the&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 virus will be enlisted. Patient data from reference centers will be introduced into&#xD;
      the card via a web service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific committee of the project has discussed and approved a set of data that will be&#xD;
      collected by local centers and that will feed the data collection database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be launched in every Italian center that requires participation. The Italian&#xD;
      Society of Thalassaemia and Hemoglobinopathies (SITE) in its role as a scientific reporting&#xD;
      company for pathology and the Foranemia Foundation, a non-profit organization, makes&#xD;
      available to the center of microcitemie, coordinator of the study, a special web space for&#xD;
      online data collection assuming the costs.&#xD;

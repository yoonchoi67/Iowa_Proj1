  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In line with BRAC's overall goals to limit the COVID19 transmission, BRAC has constructed&#xD;
      1,000 handwashing stations coupled with other supports i.e. in-person demonstration, hygiene&#xD;
      meetings, and soap distribution in Bangladesh. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      impact of public handwashing stations (HWSs) on people's hygiene behavior and health outcomes&#xD;
      in response to the COVID-19 situation. For this, at the household level, we will collect&#xD;
      information on self-reported handwashing practices, income, health status, and HWSs along&#xD;
      with other relevant socio-demographic variables in detail. In addition, we will observe&#xD;
      people's mobility, mask usage at public places, and the HWSs usage; and will associate the&#xD;
      observed HWSs usage with their self-reported health outcomes. This study will conduct surveys&#xD;
      on households (7,760) and public (5,820) in 20 sub-districts of Mymensingh, Khulna, and Dhaka&#xD;
      divisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this study is expected to directly benefit study participants and their communities&#xD;
      by unveiling new evidence to inform BRAC's existing hygiene behavioral change programming in&#xD;
      these communities. In addition, this information will yield future societal benefits by&#xD;
      generating evidence on how to effectively implement and disseminate infrastructure and&#xD;
      information that people can trust, believe, and use to form healthy hygiene habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In line with the overall goals of HBCC for reducing the transmission of COVID-19 via rapid&#xD;
      response interventions to raise awareness and enacting long-term behaviour change regarding&#xD;
      people's personal and environmental hygiene habits, BRAC has taken an adaptive approach under&#xD;
      the Hygiene and Behaviour Change Collation (HBCC) platform. The aim of this project is to&#xD;
      systematically change the behaviour of people across communities in Bangladesh via&#xD;
      interventions such as setting up handwashing stations and broadcasting behaviourally-informed&#xD;
      messages to nudge people to adopt healthier prevention and response practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the overall goals of the project and positively impact the lives of over 10&#xD;
      million people in communities across Bangladesh, BRAC primarily chose 20 sub-districts from 3&#xD;
      divisions (out of a total of 8 divisions) for implementing the interventions, namely Dhaka,&#xD;
      Mymensingh and Khulna. The prime activity is to install 1,000 handwashing stations across&#xD;
      these sub-districts to increase the access of communities to handwashing facilities. The BRAC&#xD;
      handwashing stations have been designed to enhance both availability and inclusiveness,&#xD;
      fitted with foot-operated pedals for dispensing water and liquid soap, to reduce contact with&#xD;
      sink surfaces and thereby reduce probability of transmission from the device surface. They&#xD;
      have been fitted with posters, promoting handwashing with proper technique, and have also&#xD;
      been designed to allow hand-washers to maintain social distance while using the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these handwashing stations, there are other supports available in the&#xD;
      intervention areas i.e. in-person demonstration, hygiene meetings, and soap distribution.&#xD;
      After the economy opened up in Bangladesh after a long lockdown, the community engagement&#xD;
      activities in the form of in-person communication and forum discussions, to motivate people&#xD;
      to uptake safe hygiene behaviours including but not limited to regular handwashing. In these&#xD;
      demonstrations and meetings, the participants are motivated to adopt recommended hygiene&#xD;
      behaviours such as handwashing with soap, mask usage and disposal, sneezing etiquette, social&#xD;
      distancing, etc. Along with the BRAC staff, the WASH entrepreneurs who are members of the&#xD;
      local community whom BRAC traditionally supports with free training in entrepreneurship and&#xD;
      market development to improve the communities' access and knowledge of hygiene products. The&#xD;
      HBCC project empowers them with responsibilities to disseminate the messages of the&#xD;
      recommended behaviours and distribute the soap in the communities across the intervention&#xD;
      areas, especially the poorest of the poor community and the participants who attend the&#xD;
      meetings regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes (end points)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome variables of interest in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) daily handwashing frequency ii) likelihood of using soap when handwashing iii) prevalence&#xD;
      of transmissible diseases in the past 15 days Primary Outcomes (explanation) i) constructed&#xD;
      using the self-reported daily frequency of handwashing and typical handwashing times ii)&#xD;
      constructed using self-report (times out of 10), rapid observation of the presence of soap&#xD;
      near handwashing facilities, and self-reported expenditure on soap iii) constructed using&#xD;
      self-report of symptoms and specific diseases Secondary Outcomes i) knowledge of handwashing&#xD;
      practices ii) attitudes towards handwashing iii) use of public handwashing stations and&#xD;
      alternatives to public handwashing stations iii) frequency of mask-wearing&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To understand whether access to public handwashing stations improves people's hygiene practices, we collected a list of potential villages from BRAC-WASH programme where BRAC can install the public handwashing stations in their selected 20 sub-districts in Bangladesh. Then, from each of these sub-districts we randomly selected 10 villages, of which 5 villages are assigned to the control group, which will not receive HBCC interventions (i.e., no new public handwashing stations or related community demonstrations/communications). The rest of the 5 villages are assigned to the treatment group where BRAC's WASH team must implement the HBCC interventions. We have 98 villages (from 20 sub-districts) to control and 96 to treatment. Because of an insufficient number of village selection in Khulna city (one of the 20 sub-districts), we had to reduce the number of treatment and control villages from this sub-district. In the rest of the villages listed, the program may/may not be implemented.</intervention_model_description>

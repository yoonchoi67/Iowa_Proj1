  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study of health care workers utilizes wearable sensors, surveys and symptom&#xD;
      logs, and biospecimens in an effort to improve self-monitoring practices for COVID-19 among&#xD;
      health care workers and to provide key data for the development of a predictive model for&#xD;
      early detection of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health care workers work on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, so early detection of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection is especially important in this population in order to prevent the spread&#xD;
      of disease among the health care workforce, their patients, and their families. However,&#xD;
      standard symptomatic COVID-19 testing is insufficient to protect health care workers and&#xD;
      prevent the spread of disease. This study utilizes continuous physiological data from&#xD;
      wearable sensors and surveys completed via smartphone technology, in conjunction with&#xD;
      biospecimens, in order to assist health care workers in their self-monitoring for COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Subjects will wear smart watches and temperature monitoring patches to collect&#xD;
      continuous heart rate and temperature data. Subjects will also complete baseline and exit&#xD;
      surveys, in addition to daily mood and symptom logging surveys. Finally, subjects will&#xD;
      provide biospecimens - nasal and saliva samples and optional blood samples. Using wearable&#xD;
      sensor data in conjunction with survey data and biospecimens, this study aims to prevent the&#xD;
      spread of COVID-19 among health care workers, their patients, and their families, and to&#xD;
      eventually develop a predictive model for early detection of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <description>Health care workers are on-study for 30 days, in which they wear a smart watch and temperature patches up to daily. Subjects also may provide nasal and saliva samples up to daily during the study period, and they may opt-in to blood samples lasting up to 1 year after study completion. Through a smartphone app, participants complete surveys at baseline and at study completion, as well as daily mood surveys and symptom-reporting surveys. Finally, exit interviews occur at the end of the study period, and follow-up interviews may occur at specified timepoints up to 1 year after study completion.</description>

      Subjects will provide self-collected nasal and saliva samples up to daily during the study&#xD;
      period. These samples will be used to test for SARS-CoV-2, which will help to establish an&#xD;
      estimate of the asymptomatic carrier frequency in the health care worker population. Subjects&#xD;
      can also opt-in to providing blood samples at up to three time points within a year of&#xD;
      enrollment, with a goal of determining baseline and changes in antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      as well as obtaining specimens for the measurement of other immunologic parameters and&#xD;
      biomarkers - including immune cell profiling and DNA/RNA-seq analysis. Subjects that receive&#xD;
      a diagnosis of COVID-19 while on-study may provide additional nasal swabs, saliva, and/or&#xD;
      blood specimens up to 1 year after study completion.&#xD;

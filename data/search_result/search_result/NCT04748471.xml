  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the immunogenicity of Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine in volunteers&#xD;
      aged 65 years or more compared to volunteers aged 18-45 years, over 24 months duration. It&#xD;
      will provide necessary data on the early immunological response to the vaccine and its&#xD;
      evolution in quantitative and qualitative terms. This study will allow establishing how aging&#xD;
      influences the response to the vaccine and help to adapt the vaccinal plan. For instance it&#xD;
      will suggest the necessity of a vaccination booster.&#xD;

      Phase II, comparative, non-randomized trial assessing the immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      vaccine candidate Moderna-1273 against SARS-CoV-2. A total of 180 volunteers will be included&#xD;
      and vaccinated (2 doses, at day 1 and day 29), divided in 3 groups (60 volunteers 18 - 45&#xD;
      years old, 60 volunteers 65 - 74 years old, 60 volunteers at least 75 years old). Vaccinated&#xD;
      volunteers of the three arms will be immune-monitored during 24 months via a battery of in&#xD;
      vitro and ex vivo tests to comprehensively assess the course of humoral, cellular and mucosal&#xD;
      immunity over time.&#xD;

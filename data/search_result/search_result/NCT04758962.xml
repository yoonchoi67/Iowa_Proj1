      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immune response of a&#xD;
      self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform with severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike antigen (CoV-2 SAM [LNP] vaccine) in ascending&#xD;
      doses when administered intramuscularly (IM) on a 0,1-month schedule to healthy adults 18 to&#xD;
      50 years of age.&#xD;

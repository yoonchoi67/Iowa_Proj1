  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the use of oxygen hoods as compared to conventional high-flow oxygen&#xD;
      delivery systems, and the effects on oxygenation, mechanical ventilation and mortality rates&#xD;
      in hypoxic patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether Oxygen hoods improve O2-saturation (SaO2), and how they effect length of&#xD;
      hospitalization, and in-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates in Covid-19&#xD;
      patients when compared to conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems. Oxy-hemoglobin&#xD;
      saturation is continuously measured by pulse-oximetry including immediately before and after&#xD;
      oxygen hood placement, and will be measured in controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison/Control Group The control cohort includes COVID-19 patients presenting for&#xD;
      treatment prior to 4/3/20 when hyperbaric oxygen hoods were not available. Patients&#xD;
      maintained on, or those failing on conventional O2- delivery systems and subsequently&#xD;
      receiving mechanical ventilation will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included must have tested positive using PCR swabs and/or been diagnosed based&#xD;
      on clinical/laboratory standard diagnostic criteria. Medical management will include evolving&#xD;
      treatment regimens and other standard medical treatments widely used at time of study in all&#xD;
      hypoxic COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic/confounding covariates are to be collected through Electronic Medical Record (EMR)&#xD;
      chart review and compared between intervention and control cohorts. including: Age, Body Mass&#xD;
      Index (BMI), Gender, Chronic Lung disease - COPD, Asthma (CLD), cardiovascular disease - CAD,&#xD;
      CHF, Chronic Dysrhythmia (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), Immunosuppression - History of&#xD;
      Cancer, Immunosuppressive medication, HIV (Immunosuppression), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and&#xD;
      pertinent lab markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine follow-up evaluation is maintained until final in-hospital outcomes are known&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oxygen Difference pre/post-hood (SaO2 difference, %)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intubation/MV status (Intubated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Survival/Mortality (Expired)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hospital Length of Stay (LOS, days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization/Blinding Randomization is not possible as it is unethical to deny a hypoxic&#xD;
      patient an alternative approved means of oxygenation for patients failing on conventional&#xD;
      oxygen delivery systems. No blinding of participants or investigators.&#xD;

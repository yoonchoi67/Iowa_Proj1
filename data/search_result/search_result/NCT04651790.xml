      The study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of two vaccination schedules&#xD;
      of an inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. Two doses of the vaccine&#xD;
      will be administered in a 0,14 and a 0,28-day schedule. Follow-up of safety and efficacy will&#xD;
      be assessed for 12 months after the first dose. Immunogenicity will be studied in a subgroup&#xD;
      of participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of two vaccination&#xD;
      schedules of an inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. This study will&#xD;
      be performed in 8 centers. Two schedules will be compared: 0,14 and 0,28-day, at a 1:1 rate.&#xD;
      40% of participants will be 60 or more years-old. Follow-up of safety and efficacy will be&#xD;
      assessed for 12 months after administering the first dose. The collection of the data will be&#xD;
      through an electronic Case Report Form. Immunogenicity will be studied in a subgroup of&#xD;
      participants. Initially, 2,300 volunteers will be recruited.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of confirmed symptomatic SARS CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant (confirmed by positive urine pregnancy test) or breastfeeding females, and/or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of an allergic reaction to the vaccine or components of the study vaccine or&#xD;
             placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of uncontrolled neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or renal disease,&#xD;
             according to anamnesis or physical examination; Significant changes in treatment or&#xD;
             hospitalizations due to worsening of the condition in the last three months are&#xD;
             indicators of uncontrolled disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases that impair the immune system including neoplasms (except basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma), congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, and uncontrolled autoimmune&#xD;
             diseases not controlled according to anamnesis or physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or his medical representative, affects the participant's ability to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of immunosuppressive therapies six months before inclusion in the study or its&#xD;
             scheduled use within two years of inclusion. Immunosuppressive therapies will be&#xD;

             corticosteroids considered immunosuppressive is equivalent to prednisone at a dose of&#xD;
             20 mg/day for adults for more than a week. The continuous use of topical or nasal&#xD;
             corticosteroids is not considered immunosuppressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of asplenia, either anatomic or functional.&#xD;

          -  Have received any vaccine with a live attenuated virus in the last 28 days or&#xD;
             inactivated vaccine in the last 14 days before their inclusion in the study, or have&#xD;
             immunization scheduled for the first 28 days after their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial with product administration under&#xD;
             investigation during the six months before its inclusion in the study or scheduled&#xD;
             participation in another clinical trial in the two years following inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in a COVID-19 vaccine evaluation study or previous exposure to&#xD;
             a COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever (&gt;37.8°C) within 72 hours before vaccination.&#xD;

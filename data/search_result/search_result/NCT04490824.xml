  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary reports have been received from several sources that the periodic inhaling of the&#xD;
      nebulized mist from water that has a heightened level of kinetic activity has quickly (less&#xD;
      than 2 days) lessened the severity of symptoms in Covid-19 infected patients. On at least&#xD;
      several occasions, a repeat PCR test performed several after inhaling a particular&#xD;
      water-based product was negative. There are no perceived adverse effects from inhaling the&#xD;
      water mist by using a nebulizer or humidifier. It is important, however, to validate these&#xD;
      preliminary findings and to include the inhaling of the mist from water, which does not have&#xD;
      an elevated level of kinetic activity. This will be by performed in a patient-blinded manner&#xD;
      by sequentially inhaling the two types of water over consecutive 2-day periods with Covid-19&#xD;
      testing at the end of each of the two day periods. Participants will be randomized as to&#xD;
      whether they are to inhale the mist from the test or the control water.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several producers of activated water have been in frequent communication with the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI) over the last decade or longer. They have regularly supplied their water&#xD;
      products to the PI for laboratory testing, including measuring an activity attributed to the&#xD;
      absorption of an environmental force, referred to by the PI as KELEA, an abbreviation for&#xD;
      Kinetic Energy Limiting Electrostatic Attraction. KELEA is regarded as the source of cellular&#xD;
      energy for the body's alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway can provide a&#xD;
      non-immunological defense mechanism against infections, presumably including coronaviruses.&#xD;
      The proposed study is to test water products from several suppliers, as well as a naturally&#xD;
      available source of KELEA activated water in symptomatic individuals who have tested positive&#xD;
      by either PCR or antigen testing for Covid-19. The mode of administration will be by&#xD;
      inhalation using a nebulizer or diffuser. Several deep inhalations will be taken on 5&#xD;
      occasions daily. Prior to the first inhalation and at the end of the second day of&#xD;
      inhalation, swabs will be taken for Covid-19 PCR and/or antigen testing. Randomly allocated&#xD;
      participants will either blindly first test the KELEA excellerated water for two days,&#xD;
      followed by using water without an elevated level of KELEA and vice versa. The severity of&#xD;
      symptoms will also be monitored at the end of each of the two-days periods of inhalation.&#xD;

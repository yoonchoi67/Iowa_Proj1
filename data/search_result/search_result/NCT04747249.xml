  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns of the risk of infection may lead to fear,&#xD;
      anxiety or psychological disorders that may become generalised and long-lasting,&#xD;
      corresponding to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD generally occurs in&#xD;
      circumstances such as terrorist attacks, hostage-taking, bombings, aggression, accidents...&#xD;
      The current health crisis also represents an increased risk of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first moments of stress, the illness becomes more diffuse: personality change&#xD;
      (introverted/extraverted), sleep disorders, heart problems, hypervigilance reaction,&#xD;
      agoraphobia, symptoms of reminiscence, irritability, decreased concentration, memory loss...&#xD;
      In some people, PTSD can lead to more disabling problems such as (crowd) avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to help patients with PTSD, clinical psychology offers therapeutic approaches which,&#xD;
      starting from a debriefing with the patient, provide supportive therapy which (i) reassures&#xD;
      by providing information on the symptomatology, in order to play down the present state of&#xD;
      mind, (ii) allows for the expression of what was experienced during the event, (iii)&#xD;
      initiates a process of elaboration of the trauma through transference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study initiated at the François Baclesse Centre during the first confinement, which&#xD;
      included 735 patients from April to June 2020, made it possible to assess the impact of the&#xD;
      pandemic linked to COVID-19 on the care of cancer patients treated in day hospitals, but also&#xD;
      to evaluate the PTSD experienced by patients, sleep difficulties, quality of life, cognitive&#xD;
      complaints and confinement conditions using validated questionnaires. This study showed that&#xD;
      21% of patients had proven PTSD and 23% had insomnia problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to evaluate the value of adapted psychological care for patients with&#xD;
      PTSD in relation to the pandemic on the improvement of PTSD, as well as on resilience,&#xD;
      quality of life and sleep.&#xD;

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The corona pandemic is a continuing global challenge due to Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the capability of Haemato-oncology patients to&#xD;
      generate antibodies against COVID-19 after infection and vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a backlog of patients with respiratory disease was identified in Hubei&#xD;
      Province, China. The number of infections increased rapidly, and more patients were&#xD;
      identified in other provinces in China, and in various countries in the Far East, Europe and&#xD;
      the United States. With few exceptions, patients became infected while staying in China. The&#xD;
      cause of the disease has been identified as a virus from the corona family - SARS-CoV-2 and&#xD;
      the new name given to the disease. (COVID-19) Coronavirus disease The virus belongs to a&#xD;
      family of respiratory viruses that often cause mild respiratory illness, however, viruses&#xD;
      from this family have also caused epidemics of severe respiratory infections. On March 11,&#xD;
      2020, the World Health Organization declared the corona virus a global pandemic. The average&#xD;
      incubation period (from exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms) is 6 days, with a range&#xD;
      of 2 to 11 days. Common symptoms of coronary heart disease include: fever, cough, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, muscle aches.Some patients develop complications, including pneumonia, respiratory&#xD;
      failure, myocarditis and death. Similar to other respiratory viruses, 2019-nCov is&#xD;
      transmitted by respiratory droplets. Diagnosis is made by PCR examination from a sample of&#xD;
      the upper respiratory tract (pharynx and nose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature accumulated in recent months suggests that haemato-oncology patients are at&#xD;
      increased risk for severe corona disease and mortality. In haemato-oncology patients the&#xD;
      recovery process from corona may be prolonged, including a prolonged secretion of the virus&#xD;
      compared to a healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population: CLL, Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma patients as well control group of&#xD;
      healthy patients who are vaccinated with COVID-19 in a commercial preparation, regardless of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology test between two and three weeks after the second dose of the vaccine to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the vaccine will be performed as part of the study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected in the study will be typed into Excel and analyzed using SPSS version&#xD;
      21.0. Continuous data will be described using averages and standard deviations, and&#xD;
      categorical data will be described using prevalence and percentages.&#xD;

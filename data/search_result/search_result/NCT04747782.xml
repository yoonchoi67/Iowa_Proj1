    <textblock>
      Profile known and novel biomarkers in blood in COVID19 patients to characterize the host&#xD;
      response to SARS-CoV-2 over time and in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better understand the disease. The investigators will achieve this by characterizing the&#xD;
           biology of COVID-19 infection and the pathophysiology of the host response using&#xD;
           clinical data together with cellular and molecular measurements over the course of the&#xD;
           disease. This will allow better insights for the discovery and development of novel&#xD;
           therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand why different patients have different phenotypes and disease presentations&#xD;
           over time. The investigators will achieve this by analyzing for patient subgroups. This&#xD;
           will allow targeted patient stratification and better matching of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand how patients are responding to the different medications being tested in&#xD;
           clinical trials. The investigators will achieve that by co-enrolling with therapeutic&#xD;
           trials. This will allow an understanding of the biological effects of these&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Observational adaptive study of a translational nature, combining clinical data&#xD;
      and basic science investigations in blood samples in the same patients, longitudinally, with&#xD;
      serial interim analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: 90 day ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes: measures of ICU utilization and&#xD;
      disease severity, and 90 day in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study ends after 3 months from admission to the ICU, hospital discharge or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: St. Michael's Hospital (Unity Health Toronto), an academic center in downtown&#xD;
      Toronto affiliated with the University of Toronto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect: A) Detailed clinical data including investigations,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular parameters. B) Blood samples for state-of-the-art&#xD;
      multi-omics biomarker discovery and development: cytokines, anti-COVID19 antibodies,&#xD;
      autoimmune serology, metabolomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, deep immune phenotyping,&#xD;
      viral loads. For those patients who die with COVID19 The investigators will perform bedside&#xD;
      post-mortem biopsies of lung, heart, kidney and muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling times: From admission to the maximal severity phase through convalescence, in order&#xD;
      to capture the evolution and dynamics of the disease and the recovery process: days 0,1, 3,&#xD;
      5, 7, 10, 15 and 22, and then every 2 weeks until the end of the study (3 months from&#xD;
      admission to the ICU, hospital discharge or death).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Primary Cohort: Patients admitted to the ICU with respiratory deterioration suspected&#xD;
             or confirmed to be due to SARS-CoV-2. Suspicion will be based on the clinical criteria&#xD;
             in place at SMH, with the threshold for inclusion being a suspicion high enough to use&#xD;
             PPE until confirmatory testing results are obtained. Only patients found to be COVID19&#xD;
             positive will stay in this cohort. This population will be called &quot;ICU Positive&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Secondary Cohort: Patients admitted to the ICU for any reason who are COVID19&#xD;
             positive, regardless of admission date or when they are found to be COVID19 positive.&#xD;
             This population will be called &quot;ICU Positive - delayed&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biological controls in the ICU: Any patients from the primary cohort who are found to&#xD;
             be COVID19 negative. This population will be called &quot;ICU negative&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biological controls outside the ICU: Patients admitted to the floor with respiratory&#xD;
             deterioration suspected or confirmed to be due to SARS-CoV-2, or that develop such&#xD;
             respiratory deterioration within 15 days of admission (i.e. become &quot;persons under&#xD;
             investigation&quot;). Suspicion will be based on the clinical criteria in place at SMH,&#xD;
             with the threshold for inclusion being a suspicion high enough to use PPE until&#xD;
             confirmatory testing results are obtained. Only patients found to be COVID19 positive&#xD;
             will stay in this cohort. If these patients require ICU admission within 15 days, they&#xD;
             will cross-over to the &quot;ICU positive&quot; cohort and count towards that cohort (i.e.&#xD;
             number of recruited patients). If they don't require ICU admission within 15 days,&#xD;
             they will stay in this cohort and be called &quot;never ICU&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers: The investigators will recruit healthy volunteers among healthcare&#xD;
             workers and allied personnel in the hospital. They will provide peripheral blood to&#xD;
             serve as: a) independent controls for experimental and laboratory variables, and b)&#xD;
             references of healthy baseline state for experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient previously enrolled as a COVID negative can be re-enrolled in a subsequent&#xD;
             hospitalization with a new study ID (i.e. counts as another encounter for the total&#xD;
             enrollment). The records will be linked to indicate they represent the same person&#xD;
             enrolled again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refusal to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to record the primary outcome during the first 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the ICU positive and ICU negative cohorts only: failure to obtain the day 0 or 1&#xD;
             blood sample (for example technical problems, or identification of COVID-19 after ICU&#xD;
             admission i.e. there was no suspicion on admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the ward patients, inability to collect day 1 or 2 blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to have had COVID in the past (&gt;4 weeks) in any setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers only: COVID19 known or suspected infection, or unprotected exposure&#xD;
             to a known acutely ill COVID19 patient in the past 4 weeks; and/or currently unwell or&#xD;
             in the course of an acute illness.&#xD;

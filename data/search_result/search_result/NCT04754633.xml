      To present the first admission chest computed tomography (CT) findings of patients followed&#xD;
      up with a diagnosis of COVID-19, and to compare the two classification systems by evaluating&#xD;
      these findings according to the BSTI and RSNA guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 764 adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 inpatient of researchers'&#xD;
      hospital 2020 were included in this study. The findings were recorded as typical,&#xD;
      indeterminate, and atypical by the RSNA guidelines and as classical COVID-19, possible&#xD;
      COVID-19, indeterminate, and non-COVID-19 by the BSTI classification. The data obtained&#xD;
      according to both classification systems were compared with each other.&#xD;

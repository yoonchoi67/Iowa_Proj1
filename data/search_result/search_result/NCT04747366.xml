  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NAPKON-HAP is the deep phenotyping platform of the National Pandemic Cohort Network (NAPKON)&#xD;
      in Germany. NAPKON is a data and biospecimen collection of patients with COVID-19 and is part&#xD;
      of the University Medicine Network (NUM) in Germany. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive collection of data and biosamples for researchers from national&#xD;
      consortia and for participation in international research collaborations for studying&#xD;
      COVID-19 and future pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected from patients with COVID-19 three times per week during their&#xD;
      hospitalization and at follow-up visits after hospital discharge 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months&#xD;
      after symptom onset. Data include epidemiological and demographic parameters, medical history&#xD;
      and potential risk factors, documentation of routine medical procedures, and clinical course,&#xD;
      including different patterns of organ involvement, quality of care, morbidity, and quality of&#xD;
      life. Moreover, extensive serial high-quality bio sampling consisting of various sample types&#xD;
      is performed to allow deep molecular, immunological, and virological phenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/ Intermediate Care (IMC) treatment will&#xD;
      receive 7 and patients requiring ICU/IMC treatment will receive 16 full-phenotyping visits&#xD;
      including sampling for biobanking. During hospitalisation the planned blood sampling rate in&#xD;
      total is 35 ml at each visit. The total amounts and/or sampling dates may differ according to&#xD;
      the ethics committee's regulations for different study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up visits, the clinical assessment includes an update of the medical history and&#xD;
      recent medical events from which additional clinical data is collected (i.e. outpatient&#xD;
      CT-scans, echocardiography, external laboratory data). Clinical symptoms are recorded and a&#xD;
      physical examination will be performed. Vital signs are recorded and routine blood testing&#xD;
      and biosampling is continued. Quality of life is measured with patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits at months 3 and 12 are &quot;deep phenotyping&quot; visits with a comprehensive and&#xD;
      detailed set of examinations. In the following visits at months 24 and 36, only examinations&#xD;
      with pathologic results from the last deep phenotyping visit at month 12 will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A shorter follow-up visit to record quality of life, recent medical events and with a reduced&#xD;
      number of examinations focusing on cardiorespiratory performance will take place at month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of relevant medical events, new medical information or changes in the participant´s&#xD;
      health status, an unscheduled visit can take place anytime within the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection during follow up includes standardized quality of life assessment including&#xD;
      PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System). The pulmonary&#xD;
      characterization will include body plethysmography, diffusion capacity, respiratory muscles&#xD;
      strength measurement, spiroergometry, capillary blood gas analysis and lung imaging studies&#xD;
      (low-dose Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lung).&#xD;
      Cardiological phenotyping includes echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), 24h-ECG,&#xD;
      24h-blood pressure monitoring, stress cardiac MRI and pulse wave analysis. Neurocognitive&#xD;
      testing includes brain MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG), somatosensory testing, refractometry&#xD;
      (Visit 3 and 12 months), physical activity test, neurocognitive tests, somatosensory&#xD;
      phenotyping, taste- and smell-test. Endocrinological phenotyping will incorporate Advanced&#xD;
      Glycation Endproducts (AGE) reader, continuous glucose monitoring for 14 days, Air&#xD;
      Displacement Plethysmography (ADP) or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).&#xD;

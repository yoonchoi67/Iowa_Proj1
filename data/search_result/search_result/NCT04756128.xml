      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of two medications-colchicine and low-dose&#xD;
      naltrexone (LDN)-relative to standard of care (SOC) on COVID-19 disease progression to&#xD;
      severe/critical illness and/or intubation in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19. As&#xD;
      researchers have learned, COVID-19's clinical course suggests that the hyperinflammatory&#xD;
      response seen in severe/critical cases is involved in the pathogenesis of associated adverse&#xD;
      sequelae such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thromboembolic disease, and&#xD;
      acute cardiac injury. Given colchicine has demonstrated clinical utility in inflammatory&#xD;
      syndromes within these systems (e.g. endothelial/vascular/myocardial), and LDN acts both to&#xD;
      boost the immune system, and limit an excessive response; they may prove useful in minimizing&#xD;
      the risk of disease progression and associated adverse sequelae.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus caused a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.&#xD;
      The identified virus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated illness named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (WHO). In the&#xD;
      months since its discovery, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to tens of millions of cases&#xD;
      worldwide. In the United States alone, there have been over 11.6 million cases of COVID-19,&#xD;
      with over 340,000 attributed deaths reported as of December 31, 2020 (CDC Cases in the US).&#xD;
      Despite the recent availability of a preventative vaccine, there are limited&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic treatment options for those with an active infection, the majority of&#xD;
      which remain investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common symptoms among patients with mild disease include fever, altered senses of smell or&#xD;
      taste, fatigue, or cough. More severe cases of COVID-19 may lead to hypoxemia and pneumonia.&#xD;
      When compared to those with less-severe disease, severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia generally&#xD;
      results in an increase in circulating proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. The&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus has specific structural components (e.g. viroporin E and viroporins 3a and&#xD;
      8A) that have been shown to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes NLRP3 has been found to be a major&#xD;
      pathophysiologic component in developing ARDS; and inflammasome activation along with&#xD;
      subsequent cytokine production is seen with myocardial injury, which may provide mechanistic&#xD;
      insight to SARS-CoV-2's ability to cause cardiac insult. Additionally, aberrant activation of&#xD;
      neutrophils and formation of excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were found to be&#xD;
      associated with ARDS, and recently to be the potential central cause of severe/critical&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments that influence neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation and&#xD;
      hyper-inflammatory response may prove beneficial for reduction in disease progression,&#xD;
      adverse sequelae, and mortality associated with COVID-19 infections. Agents under&#xD;
      investigation to mitigate this detrimental host response include the IL-6 receptor&#xD;
      antagonists. However, their extreme expense, scarce availability, and high-risk for severe&#xD;
      adverse effects relegate the use of these injectable agents to cases that have already&#xD;
      progressed to critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colchicine is an oral anti-inflammatory agent that is relatively inexpensive, readily&#xD;
      available, and has been used for generations. Approved for treatment and prophylaxis of gout&#xD;
      flares and Mediterranean fever, it is also used in a variety of other inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions. Colchicine binds to tubulin causing depolymerization, which interferes with&#xD;
      neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and mobilization to sites of inflammation, and contributes&#xD;
      to reduction in superoxide production; through interference of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein&#xD;
      complex, colchicine inhibits IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-18 production. These are recognized as&#xD;
      playing an important role in acute coronary syndrome, pericarditis, and ARDS. Colchicine also&#xD;
      has an anti-apoptotic action on endothelial cells that may provide benefit in minimizing&#xD;
      extravasation, capillary leak, and therefore progression or development of ARDS. Lastly,&#xD;
      coronavirus replication, virion particle assembly, and subsequent exocytosis from the host&#xD;
      cell, have been shown to rely on cytoplasmic structural proteins (microtubules) for&#xD;
      trafficking during its lifecycle. Disrupting microtubule trafficking has the potential to&#xD;
      interfere with these key viral replication steps, and therefore introduction of a microtubule&#xD;
      depolymerizing agent may help treat a coronavirus infection through decreased viral&#xD;
      replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of colchicine in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been studied in several&#xD;
      small uncontrolled case series and comparative cohort studies, as well as small, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. Results have been unanimously favorable thus far, though they have&#xD;
      substantial limitations. Some were performed during local COVID-19 surges, rates of&#xD;
      intubation and mortality were likely inflated as a result, and therefore the benefits of&#xD;
      colchicine may be overestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most well known as an opioid antagonist, or a treatment for alcohol dependence, naltrexone&#xD;
      also possesses immunomodulatory effects. Seen exclusively at low doses, this attribute is&#xD;
      being employed in the pain community as a novel anti-inflammatory agent that has been shown&#xD;
      to reduce symptom severity in fibromyalgia, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
      Naltrexone is a 50:50 racemic mixture of both L and R isomers - in theory, these isomers&#xD;
      allow it to act in a dualistic fashion, both boosting the immune system yet limiting an&#xD;
      excessive immune response. The L isomer is a competitive inhibitor of the Mu and Kappa opioid&#xD;
      receptor, resulting in elevated levels of endogenous endorphins and enkephalins, which in&#xD;
      turn, functions as an immune enhancer. The R isomer blocks the toll like receptor and&#xD;
      modulates T and B cell activity; the downstream effects limit the release of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines including IL-6, IL-12, TNF alpha, and NF-KB. A study in 2017 demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant reduction in cytokines after eight weeks of therapy in eight female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While preliminary LDN studies demonstrate success in Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, there is still a need for follow-up trials to establish definitive evidence of&#xD;
      benefit. The lack of proprietary value in a generic medication with no industry backing has&#xD;
      hampered widespread adoption and FDA approval. Thus, clinical efficacy data is slowly&#xD;
      forthcoming on LDN. At the same time, the safety profile of naltrexone is well established&#xD;
      and very well tolerated in alcohol use disorder. Considering that is a high-risk population,&#xD;
      and the dose used is significantly higher (25-100mg versus 1-4.5mg for LDN), it stands to&#xD;
      reason that LDN should have little to no toxicity. Hepatic function has to be monitored at&#xD;
      higher doses, and the drug should be stopped if necessary. However, with LDN the majority of&#xD;
      adverse drug effects are constitutional (headache, dizziness, nausea etc.), with no end organ&#xD;
      damage and no evidence for opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously outlined, available evidence demonstrates that excessive immune response in the&#xD;
      form of a &quot;cytokine storm&quot; plays a key role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 offering this&#xD;
      process as a possible target for drug therapy. Known immunomodulatory effects of LDN suggest&#xD;
      that this drug could be used to reduce this exaggerated immune response. While the efficacy&#xD;
      of LDN is being studied in COVID-19 (NCT04604704, NCT04604678, NCT04365985) in combination&#xD;
      with a nutritional supplement, metformin, and ketamine (respectively), only the latter trial&#xD;
      is recruiting at this time, and none includes colchicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will investigate whether or not the colchicine and naltrexone (used alone&#xD;
      or in combination) can slow the progression of COVID-19 patients hospitalized with mild&#xD;
      illness. A modified version of the World Health Organization's R&amp;D Blueprint Ordinal Clinical&#xD;
      Scale will be used to assess this outcome. Patients enrolled in the study will follow the&#xD;
      schedule of events outlined below. If randomized to receive study drug (colchicine only,&#xD;
      naltrexone only, or both colchicine and naltrexone) patients will continue to take the&#xD;
      medication until discharge form the hospital (but not more than 28 days).&#xD;

      Dosing strategy-Colchicine Patients randomized to a colchicine-containing treatment arm will&#xD;
      receive colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for up to 28 days. On the day of enrollment, provided&#xD;
      the first dose can be given prior to 16:00 that day, patients are eligible to receive two&#xD;
      doses; the second dose will be scheduled for 22:00. Patients experiencing gastrointestinal&#xD;
      side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) on twice daily dosing may have the dose&#xD;
      decreased to 0.6 mg daily. Dosing will continue twice daily unless there is a change that&#xD;
      requires a dose adjustment or an exclusion criterion is met. Dosing deviations above the&#xD;
      study protocol will be allowed if medically necessary for the treatment of an additional&#xD;
      indication (e.g. colchicine for viral pericarditis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CrCl* ≥50 mL/min: colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CrCl* 30-49 mL/min: colchicine 0.6 mg every 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CrCl* 11-29 mL/min**: colchicine 0.6 mg every 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CrCl* ≤10 mL/min: doses will be held&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug interactions: To ensure patients are properly screened and identified as&#xD;
      eligible/ineligible with respect to prescribed medications, this research team will identify&#xD;
      a group of study pharmacists and physicians (including the PI, Dr. Daniel Delaney, and a pain&#xD;
      specialist, Dr. Joseph Johnson), who will be available as-needed to field questions regarding&#xD;
      any medications a patient is taking during or prior to their hospital stay that may or may&#xD;
      not preclude study participation.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to a colchicine-containing treatment arm will receive colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for up to 28 days. On the day of enrollment, provided the first dose can be given prior to 16:00 that day, patients are eligible to receive two doses; the second dose will be scheduled for 22:00. Patients experiencing gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) on twice daily dosing may have the dose decreased to 0.6 mg daily. Dosing will continue twice daily unless there is a change that requires a dose adjustment or an exclusion criterion is met. Dosing deviations above the study protocol will be allowed if medically necessary for the treatment of an additional indication (e.g. colchicine for viral pericarditis).&#xD;
Patients in this arm will also receive the investigating institution's current standard of care (described in detail in the &quot;standard of care&quot; arm) for patients with COVID-19.</description>

Patients in the &quot;combined&quot; arm will also receive naltrexone. Patients randomized to an LDN-containing treatment arm (including the &quot;combined arm&quot;) will receive naltrexone 4.5 mg once daily. The first dose can be given at any time during the day of enrollment/randomization, and will be timed at 08:00 daily thereafter (with AM colchicine dose, if in combined colchicine/LDN arm) for up to 28 days (unless new contraindication or exclusion criteria met).&#xD;

    <description>Patients in this arm will receive the investigating institution's current standard of care for patients with COVID-19. For example, all patients requiring supplemental oxygen (assuming no contraindications) would be candidates for both remdesivir 200 mg x 1 IV dose followed the next day by 100 mg q24h IV x up to 4 doses, as well as dexamethasone 6 mg q24h x 10 up to 10 doses.</description>

    <intervention_name>Colchicine 0.6 mg</intervention_name>
    <description>Colchicine is an oral anti-inflammatory agent that is relatively inexpensive, readily available, and has been used for generations. Approved for treatment and prophylaxis of gout flares and Mediterranean fever, it is also used in a variety of other inflammatory conditions (e.g. pericarditis and diffuse vascular inflammation such as Behcet syndrome). Colchicine binds to tubulin causing depolymerization, which interferes with neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and mobilization to sites of inflammation, and contributes to reduction in superoxide production; through interference of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex, colchicine inhibits IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-18 production.&#xD;
For this study, patients enrolled in a colchicine containing arm will receive 0.6mg of colchicine BID (unless renal function/gastrointestinal issues require adjustments described in the protocol)</description>

    <intervention_name>Naltrexone</intervention_name>
    <description>Most well known as an opioid antagonist, or a treatment for alcohol dependence, naltrexone also possesses immunomodulatory effects. Seen exclusively at low doses, this attribute is being employed in the pain community as a novel anti-inflammatory agent that has been shown to reduce symptom severity in fibromyalgia, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and complex regional pain syndrome.&#xD;
For this study, patients enrolled in a naltrexone-containing arm will take their daily dose of the medication (4.5mg) by oral suspension.</description>

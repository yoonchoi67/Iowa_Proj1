  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that recovered COVID-19 patients suffer long term cardiovascular and pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, which can be detected by point of care ultrasound. The goal is to&#xD;
      comprehensively delineate the long term cardiovascular and pulmonary ultrasound findings in&#xD;
      recovered COVID-19 patients, identify risks factors for prolonged heart/lung injury, evaluate&#xD;
      long term effects of applied treatment, and assess late medication/vaccine side effects in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To examine the long term cardiac involvements of recovered COVID-19 patients at 3, 6,&#xD;
      12 months after being discharged from the hospital or symptom resolution with&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. 12 lead ECG will be obtained for all patients.&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed using GE Vivid E9 ultrasound system to&#xD;
      measure left ventricular (LV) dimensions, LV volumes and LV ejection fraction (EF), wall&#xD;
      thickness, LV mass, and LV remodeling index. LV diastolic function will be characterized by&#xD;
      maximum velocities of mitral inflow E and A waves, E/A ratio, E/E' ratio (maximum myocardial&#xD;
      velocities (E') of the lateral mitral annulus), isovolumetric relaxation time, tricuspid&#xD;
      regurgitation velocity, and left atrial volumes. Right-ventricular function will be assessed&#xD;
      by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), pulmonary acceleration time, and by&#xD;
      estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure. We will evaluate mitral, aortic, tricuspid&#xD;
      and pulmonic valvular stenosis and regurgitation. In addition, speckle tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography will be used to detect subclinical impairment of myocardium in patients who&#xD;
      have grossly normal LVEF. Lastly, inferior vena cava will be measured to assess patients'&#xD;
      volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate long term pulmonary involvements of recovered COVID-19 patients at 3, 6,&#xD;
      12 months after being discharged from the hospital or symptom resolution with pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      bedside spirometry and lung ultrasound. Pulse oximetry, bedside spirometry, and lung&#xD;
      ultrasonography (LUS) will be performed for all patients. The pathological LUS features for&#xD;
      every zone will be reported as: (1) normal appearance (A lines, &lt; 3 B lines), (2) pathologic&#xD;
      B lines (≥3 B lines), (3) confluent B lines, (4) thickening of the pleura with pleural line&#xD;
      irregularities (subpleural consolidation &lt; 1 cm), (5) consolidation (≥ 1 cm), (6) pleural&#xD;
      effusion. The LUS score, used as a correlate of loss of lung tissue aeration, as well as a&#xD;
      normalized LUS score corrected for the number of examined zone, will be calculated in every&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To diagnose long term vascular involvements of recovered COVID-19 patients at 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      months after being discharged from the hospital or symptom resolution with vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound. A trained physician or sonographer will use high resolution gray-scale imaging,&#xD;
      color Doppler ultrasound and spectral analysis with pulse wave Doppler to examine bilateral&#xD;
      upper/lower extremity venous and arterial systems and carotid arteries for thrombosis,&#xD;
      atheroma, and stenosis.&#xD;

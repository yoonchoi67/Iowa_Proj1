  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hallmark of the L phenotype is the vasoplegia, as confirmed by the rapid change in&#xD;
      density and distribution of CT findings from the supine to the prone position. The benefit of&#xD;
      a prone position in awake, nonintubated, spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients has been&#xD;
      emerging as potential tool to improve oxygenation and to prevent the access to ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No evidence of radiological modifications related to Aim of our study is to evaluate CT&#xD;
      changes in terms of extension, distribution and prevalence of findings, in the supine&#xD;
      compared with the prone position.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were considered eligible if were with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 infection,&#xD;
      as documented by RT-PCR nasal swab, or, confirmed by a subsequent BAL, aged between 18 and 90&#xD;
      years old, able to maintain both the supine and prone position on the CT scan table. Patients&#xD;
      who were pregnant, scarcely collaborative were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once adopted the supine position on the CT scan table, the patient received the oximeter. At&#xD;
      the end of the supine scan, arterial oxygenation was recorded. Soon after the supine scan the&#xD;
      patient adopted prone position with both arms extended anteriorly. CT scan was performed with&#xD;
      a low dosage protocol, finally the second arterial oxygenation was recorded at the end of the&#xD;
      prone scan. Patients who had oxygen requirement below 3 L/min temporarily suspended the&#xD;
      supply; whilst those with an oxygen supply more than 3 L/min maintained it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three experienced radiologists analyzed CT images on a PACS workstation, in three stages.&#xD;
      First to score the total severity score, secondly to analyze the supine scan and finally the&#xD;
      prone CT images. The images were viewed in the lung window settings (width 1000-1500 HU;&#xD;
      level 700 to -550 HU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TSS was calculated dividing each lung into three zones. The upper zone included&#xD;
      parenchyma above the carina; the middle zone from carina and inferiori pulmonary vein and,&#xD;
      finally the lower zone included the parenchyma below the inferior pulmonary vein. Each lung&#xD;
      zone was further subdivided into anterior and posterior, so that the resulting zones were 12.&#xD;
      Each zone was scored as follows: 0 with no changes; 1 with changes extent &lt;25%; 2 with&#xD;
      changes between 26 and 50%; 3, 51-75% and finally 4, &gt;75%. To obtain the final score, the sum&#xD;
      of each zone score was calculated, with a maximum value of 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this first step, for each zone, the percentage of extension of patterns was calculated&#xD;
      visually and recorded. Patterns included: pure ground glass; crazy paving; part-solid ground&#xD;
      glass; perilobular pattern, and consolidation. This semiquantitative evaluation of this five&#xD;
      patterns, was then evaluated for the prone scanning. The extension of the five patterns were&#xD;
      averaged multiplying 1 for ground glass, 2 for crazy paving; 3 for part solid ground glass; 4&#xD;
      for perilobular pattern and 5 for consolidation. Each zone showed a final averaged score.&#xD;
      Summarization of the anterior zones and posterior allows to calculate the anterior-posterior&#xD;
      ratio both in supine and prone. Moreover, summarizing the scores in supine and prone, the&#xD;
      prone-supine ratio has been calculated. A target vein, representing a &quot;outside&quot; vessel&#xD;
      enlargement&quot; has ben identified in dorsal segment of right upper lobe or in the posterobasal&#xD;
      segment of right lower lobe, measured in supine and prone, and calculated prone-supine ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a final step, CT scan has been reviewed in consensus with pulmonologists in order to&#xD;
      define qualitative pattern.&#xD;

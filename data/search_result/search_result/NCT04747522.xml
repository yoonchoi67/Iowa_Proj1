  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      None of the vaccines approved, or in clinical trials, have so far been tested on transplanted&#xD;
      patients. If they produce an immune response to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 it is unknown&#xD;
      how long the protective immunity will last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all immune responses are equal. The investigators will quantify immune cell subsets with&#xD;
      flow and mass cytometry analyses to describe the phenotype of responding immune cells,&#xD;
      including specific T cells. If not already established, patient human Leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      genotypes will be typed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare the immune responses with healthy individuals a control group of hospital&#xD;
      employees will be included and sampled before and after vaccination according to the same&#xD;
      time schedules as the kidney transplanted patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplanted patients with post-transplant follow-up visits at the national transplant&#xD;
      center in Norway will be included before they are SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated. As a control group&#xD;
      the investigators will include blood samples from healthy volunteers (hospital employees)&#xD;
      that receive vaccine as first line health care workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline blood samples will be obtained before vaccination. The vaccination will be performed&#xD;
      according to the national procedures and not necessarily by the hospital. Following&#xD;
      vaccination, all patients and controls will have blood drawn 7-10 days as well as 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      after the second dose. Depending on the results of the immunity testing the patients and&#xD;
      controls may be invited to additional blood sampling up or at specific time points to two&#xD;
      years following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each blood sampling and at the time of both vaccinations the systemic exposure of&#xD;
      tacrolimus will be assessed in kidney transplanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be analyzed with validated assays for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG)&#xD;
      (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) spike protein) using ELISA, flow cytometry bead arrays&#xD;
      and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays or comparable techniques. Cells will be analyzed by flow&#xD;
      and mass cytometry for activation and phenotype markers, and with functional assays for&#xD;
      responsiveness (e.g. proliferation and cytokine production). Samples will be HLA-typed if&#xD;
      HLA-genotype if not already established.&#xD;

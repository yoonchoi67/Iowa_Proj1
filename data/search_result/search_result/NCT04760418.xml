  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid misuse is a national public health epidemic. More than 130 people in the United States&#xD;
      die each day following an opioid overdose, and over 2 million people meet criteria for an&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (OUD). Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which involves use of&#xD;
      medication (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) in combination with behavioral therapy or&#xD;
      counseling, is the most effective intervention for OUD. Yet, MAT remains less than optimally&#xD;
      effective, particularly for patients with psychiatric comorbidity [6]. Novel approaches are&#xD;
      needed to improve long-term outcomes for OUD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly prevalent among&#xD;
      individuals with OUD. Over 90% of adults with OUD report a lifetime history of trauma. Among&#xD;
      OUD patients engaged in MAT, nearly 20% report experiencing at least one new traumatic event&#xD;
      each month, and nearly a third meet criteria for a co-occurring diagnosis of posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD). Several studies have linked new incidents of trauma as well as the&#xD;
      presence of PTSD to poorer MAT engagement and poorer treatment outcomes, including treatment&#xD;
      interruption and premature dropout. Preliminary evidence suggests that engaging in&#xD;
      trauma-focused treatment for PTSD concurrent with MAT may result in better long-term&#xD;
      adherence to medication for OUD. However, recent evidence finds that fewer than half of&#xD;
      patients with PTSD in MAT receive any trauma-focused treatment, and even fewer receive&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma-focused treatments that concurrently address symptoms of PTSD and substance abuse&#xD;
      using an integrated approach have been recommended over traditional substance abuse&#xD;
      interventions for patients with this complex dual diagnosis presentation. Concurrent&#xD;
      Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure (COPE) is a 12-session&#xD;
      evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy that integrates exposure therapy for PTSD with&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral skills for addressing problem substance use. COPE has demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy for reducing symptoms of PTSD and substance use disorder across multiple trials.&#xD;
      Most samples have included patients with alcohol use disorder or mixed substance use disorder&#xD;
      diagnoses. The proposed pilot study would collect preliminary feasibility data to support the&#xD;
      first trial of COPE for patients with OUD (and other substance use disorders) who are&#xD;
      currently engaged in MAT. As such, a primary aim of the current pilot is to obtain patient&#xD;
      feedback regarding the acceptability and applicability of COPE for patients with PTSD&#xD;
      receiving MAT treatment through the Supportive Medication Assisted Recovery Treatment (SMART)&#xD;
      Program within the University of Kentucky (UK) Department of Psychiatry, an outpatient&#xD;
      buprenorphine clinic. The investigators believe that it is critical to engage patients&#xD;
      directly in the process of intervention development/refinement to determine how an existing&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention like COPE might be modified to best fit the unique needs of&#xD;
      patients receiving MAT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients served by the SMART clinic in UK Psychiatry will be invited to complete an&#xD;
      online survey to assess for lifetime history of trauma, current PTSD symptoms perceptions of&#xD;
      how patients' trauma history and PTSD symptoms are related to their substance use (e.g., do&#xD;
      they perceive there to be a connection) and other mental health problems, whether patients&#xD;
      have received treatment directly focused on trauma and/or PTSD symptoms and if so how helpful&#xD;
      they perceived this treatment to be, and patient interest in receiving additional individual&#xD;
      trauma-focused treatment as part of their care within the SMART program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients indicating interest in trauma-focused treatment will be provided with additional&#xD;
      details regarding the purpose of the pilot trial to obtain patient feedback regarding their&#xD;
      impressions of the 12-session COPE intervention, and feedback regarding how the treatment&#xD;
      could be modified to better meet the needs of patients in the UK Psychiatry SMART Program and&#xD;
      other MAT programs. Information regarding patient recovery is collected and retained within&#xD;
      an internal database within the SMART program to track patient recovery services week-to-week&#xD;
      as part of routine clinical services. This database is retained on secured computer systems&#xD;
      within the clinic. The investigators will seek permission from participants to draw the&#xD;
      following historical information from this database and link it to the survey responses they&#xD;
      provide as part of this research study to allow us to examine whether the following clinical&#xD;
      factors differ as a function of trauma history or PTSD symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dates of scheduled and attended visits (length and frequency of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of urine drug screens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly report of substance use, mental health, physical pain, and recovery activities&#xD;
           (See attached Recovery Update Form)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications patients are taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency department visits or hospitalizations since beginning treatment In addition,&#xD;
           patients with probable PTSD on the PCL-5 who express interest in participating in the&#xD;
           pilot trial will be invited to complete clinical interviews at baseline to assess for&#xD;
           PTSD diagnosis/severity and co-occurring conditions that would contraindicate&#xD;
           participation in the treatment portion of the study (i.e., schizophrenia or other&#xD;
           psychotic disorders, current manic episode, acute suicidal ideation with intent). A&#xD;
           total of 6 patients with a current diagnosis of PTSD (who are deemed not at high risk&#xD;
           for suicide, have been actively engaged in MAT for at least 4 weeks, and are determined&#xD;
           to be medically stable) will be invited to participate in the pilot trial. Eligible&#xD;
           patients will then complete additional baseline interviews to assess substance use&#xD;
           frequency/quantity, SUD and depression diagnoses, and qualitative information regarding&#xD;
           participants' beliefs regarding the role of trauma and PTSD symptoms in their recovery,&#xD;
           satisfaction with prior treatment experience, and expectations regarding their&#xD;
           experience with COPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment part of the study will utilize a randomized, non-concurrent multiple baseline&#xD;
      design across participants. This is a form of single-case experimental design that provides a&#xD;
      time and cost-effective method of evaluating initial efficacy or effectiveness of an&#xD;
      intervention while controlling for the passage of time and repeated assessment in small&#xD;
      numbers of patients. Patients will be randomized to either a 4- (n=3) or 6-week (n =3)&#xD;
      baseline assessment phase where weekly self-report measures of PTSD symptoms will be&#xD;
      completed prior to initiating the COPE treatment. Randomizing to varying baseline periods&#xD;
      enables assessments of whether symptoms change (only or more rapidly) when the COPE&#xD;
      intervention is applied (i.e., each participant acts as their own control). This design&#xD;
      allows for causal inferences and controls for many threats to internal validity. Dr. Badour&#xD;
      (PI) will train and supervise clinical psychology doctoral student therapists in delivery of&#xD;
      the COPE intervention. Patients will meet with an independent assessor at three points&#xD;
      throughout the treatment (3 visits at baseline, 1 visit after session 6, and 2 visits after&#xD;
      session 12) to assess symptoms and to provide both quantitative and qualitative feedback&#xD;
      regarding their preferences and perspective on the treatment (e.g., treatment credibility,&#xD;
      clarity and applicability of material, patient satisfaction, therapeutic alliance) and ways&#xD;
      the content could be modified to better fit their needs. At the session 12 assessment,&#xD;
      interview measures of PTSD and depression symptoms will be repeated to assess symptom change.&#xD;
      Self-report symptoms of PTSD and depression will be administered weekly throughout treatment.&#xD;
      MAT adherence and substance use will be monitored as part of routine clinical procedures in&#xD;
      the SMART program using the attached Recovery Update Form. As not all patients are seen&#xD;
      weekly at the SMART Program, the Recovery Update Form will be administered by the research&#xD;
      team on weeks when patients do not have regular clinic visits. The addition of up to two&#xD;
      &quot;stressor&quot; sessions (for 14 total possible sessions) will be offered. Content of these&#xD;
      sessions will be allowed to deviate from the protocol to address current stressors that arise&#xD;
      during the course of treatment. A previous psychotherapy trial found that this modification&#xD;
      increases flexibility in PTSD treatment without sacrificing efficacy, and is more in line&#xD;
      with a patient-centered approach to treatment. With the exception of the addition of COPE,&#xD;
      MAT and other therapeutic programming will continue per normal (e.g., group medication&#xD;
      management, ongoing therapy groups, case management). Clinical and demographic data collected&#xD;
      by providers in the course of treatment will be obtained and examined for its relevance to&#xD;
      illness course and treatment outcome.&#xD;

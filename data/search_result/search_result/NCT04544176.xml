  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using recent data on hospital attendance and COVID-19 laboratory tests, available within&#xD;
      two NHS trusts in Nottingham and Cardiff we will enable the calculation of the risk of&#xD;
      developing COVID-19 infection after attending an outpatient hospital appointment. This will&#xD;
      assist in the restart planning when resuming face to face outpatient radiology appointment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused considerable&#xD;
      disruption to the provision of routine healthcare in the UK. A key priority for healthcare&#xD;
      providers when gaining control of COVID-19, is to restart the provision of urgent non-COVID&#xD;
      care. There are several barriers including a reluctance for people to attend hospital&#xD;
      appointments for fears of contracting COVID-19. Although SARS-COV2 infections have been&#xD;
      reported to occur during hospital inpatient stay, the risk of acquiring SARS-COV2 during&#xD;
      outpatient consultations or radiological investigations has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study at our hospitals during the pandemic, we have found radiology to reliably&#xD;
      record in person attendance contrary to outpatient clinic appointments records that were&#xD;
      contaminated by remote consultations. The investigators will calculate the incidence of&#xD;
      infection in approximately 30,000 patients at Nottingham and 17,000 patients at Cardiff and&#xD;
      calculate the risk of infection within 28 days of attending outpatient radiology&#xD;
      appointments. Controls will use data on patients who attended the hospitals in 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will utilize the data held in the electronic systems of NUH and University&#xD;
      Hospital of Wales to perform a cohort study which will comprise both an exposed cohort and&#xD;
      unexposed cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposed cohort will comprise patients who attended outpatient radiology appointments&#xD;
      during (between 29/1/20 - 24/5/20) and whether they subsequently developed a positive or&#xD;
      negative PCR test for Sars-CoV2 result within 28-days of their attendance. The unexposed&#xD;
      cohort will work as a control group, comprising individuals who attended outpatient radiology&#xD;
      appointments during the equivalent period in 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this data will be retrospective, so will not require any additional data collection,&#xD;
      nor will it interfere with routine clinical care. Pseudo-anonymised data will be transferred&#xD;
      from University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff to Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) Trust&#xD;
      via a password-protected, encrypted spreadsheet, with original patient identifiers removed,&#xD;
      and a unique code assigned, that only the researcher in Cardiff can use to trace back to the&#xD;
      individual, this is so all the analysis can be performed at NUH by a Nottingham based&#xD;
      statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team consisting of clinicians, data analysts, epidemiologist and clinical&#xD;
      researchers will analyse this information to quantify the risk of infection which will help&#xD;
      inform the recovery plans and service provision during the restart of urgent and routine&#xD;
      non-COVID care.&#xD;

        All individuals attending outpatient clinics will be included for analysis, this is&#xD;
        anticipated this to be in excess of 30,000 patients at NUH and around 17,000 patients at&#xD;
        Cardiff. To ensure a substantive number of patients are included for analysis and&#xD;
        comparison across the UK, 2 large hospitals (Nottingham University Hospitals and Cardiff&#xD;
        University Hospitals) will be participating in this study.&#xD;

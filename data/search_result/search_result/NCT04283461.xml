    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,&#xD;
      starting at 18 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid&#xD;
      nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion&#xD;
      stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at up to 3 domestic&#xD;
      clinical research sites. Up to one hundred and fifty-five subjects will be enrolled into one&#xD;
      of thirteen cohorts (10 micrograms [mcg], 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg, and 250 mcg). Subjects&#xD;
      will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliters [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1&#xD;
      and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination&#xD;
      (Day 394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2, and 4 weeks post each vaccination (Days 8, 15,&#xD;
      29, 36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post second vaccination (Days 119, 209,&#xD;
      and 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose&#xD;
      vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 5 dosages in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an optional third mRNA-1273 vaccination substudy, in subjects 18 years of age and&#xD;
      older, who received both the first and second mRNA-1273 vaccinations in the main study and&#xD;
      meet all other substudy eligibility criteria. This optional third mRNA-1273 vaccination&#xD;
      substudy is designed to assess safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity through 12 months&#xD;
      post third vaccination (Day 731). Subjects who receive the third mRNA-1273 vaccination will&#xD;
      exit the Schedule of Activities for the main study and will enter the Schedule of Activities&#xD;
      for the optional substudy. Up to one hundred and twenty subject will be enrolled into two&#xD;
      cohorts (consisting of participating subjects who received 2 doses of 25 or 50 mcg and&#xD;
      participating subjects who received 2 doses of 100 and 250 mcg). Subjects will receive an IM&#xD;
      injection (0.5 mL) at a dosage of 100 mcg/0.5 mL. The primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and reactogenicity of a third mRNA-1273 vaccination, at a dosage of 100 mcg.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be able to understand and agrees to comply with planned study procedures and be&#xD;
             available for all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Agrees to the collection of venous blood per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male or non-pregnant female, &gt;/= to 18 years of age at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.0-35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (&lt; 56 years of age), at screening;&#xD;
             BMI 18.0-30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (&gt;/= 56 years of age), at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing potential* must agree to use or have practiced true abstinence**&#xD;
             or use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception.***, **** Note: These&#xD;
             criteria are applicable to females in a heterosexual relationship and child-bearing&#xD;
             potential (i.e., the criteria do not apply to subjects in a same sex relationship).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not of childbearing potential - post-menopausal females (defined as having a&#xD;
                  history of amenorrhea for at least one year) or a documented status as being&#xD;
                  surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal&#xD;
                  ligation/salpingectomy, or Essure(R) placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  True abstinence is 100% of time no sexual intercourse (male's penis enters&#xD;
                       the female's vagina). (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception).&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Acceptable forms of primary contraception include monogamous&#xD;
                            relationship with a vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for&#xD;
                            180 days or more prior to the subject's first vaccination, intrauterine&#xD;
                            devices, birth control pills, and injectable/implantable/insertable&#xD;
                            hormonal birth control products.&#xD;

                              -  Must use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception for&#xD;
                                 at least 30 days prior to the first vaccination and at least one&#xD;
                                 acceptable primary form of contraception for 60 days after the&#xD;
                                 last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 24 hours prior to each vaccination.&#xD;

             contraception with a female partner of childbearing potential from first vaccination&#xD;
             until 60 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Biological males who are post-pubertal and considered fertile until permanently&#xD;
             sterile by bilateral orchiectomy or vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects agree to refrain from sperm donation from the time of first vaccination&#xD;
             until 60 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;

         10. In good health.* *As determined by medical history and physical examination to&#xD;
             evaluate acute or ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present&#xD;
             for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic&#xD;
             medical diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no&#xD;
             hospitalizations, emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for&#xD;
             supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication,&#xD;
             dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical&#xD;
             diagnosis/condition in the 60 days before enrollment. Any prescription change that is&#xD;
             due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial&#xD;
             reasons, and in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of&#xD;
             this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of&#xD;
             a disease outcome, as determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
             or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion&#xD;
             criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no&#xD;
             additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity,&#xD;
             and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication&#xD;
             changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the&#xD;
             change was not precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and&#xD;
             there is no anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the&#xD;
             evaluation of responses to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;

             ranges at the clinical laboratory being used.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Must agree to have samples stored for secondary research.&#xD;

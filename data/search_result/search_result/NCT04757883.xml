  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to assess the vaccine response of kidney transplant patients&#xD;
      following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be derived from cohorts of kidney transplant patients who have been&#xD;
      transplanted for more than 3 months and have no contraindications to vaccination. These&#xD;
      patients will be vaccinated as part of routine care with a CoV-2 SARS vaccine licensed in&#xD;
      France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cohort, the investigators wish to study the post-vaccination humoral response by&#xD;
      assaying neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV-2 and the specific cellular response of&#xD;
      SARS Cov-2 by quantiferon and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation assays.&#xD;

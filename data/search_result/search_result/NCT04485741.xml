  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Listening to breath sounds with the stethoscope/auscultation is used by pulmonary physicians&#xD;
      in conjunction with pulmonary function, signs and symptoms, oxygen saturation and diagnostic&#xD;
      testing to admit, follow and discharge patients from hospital. Of these, only auscultation&#xD;
      routinely ceases upon discharge from Hospital. Healthcare utilization statistics have shown&#xD;
      that for more than a decade, readmission after discharge for an exacerbation of COPD or&#xD;
      severe asthma (or chronic heart failure) remains a major problem. The Strados System has been&#xD;
      designed to extend the range of lung sound recording both geographically and temporally to&#xD;
      improve the standard of care when access to continuous monitoring has been replaced by&#xD;
      periodic or no monitoring. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the clinical&#xD;
      utility of the Strados System in enabling periodic recording and reviewing of breath sounds&#xD;
      in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, either in the ICU, or in less continuously&#xD;
      monitored settings, including after inpatient discharge.&#xD;

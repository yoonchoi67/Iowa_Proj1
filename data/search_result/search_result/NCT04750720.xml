  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to describe the temporal curve of COVID-19 IgG and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies over 24 months in an identified population of patients who presented&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The secondary objectives are to characterize the kinetics of&#xD;
      the antibodies according to the severity of the clinical presentation and patient's&#xD;
      characteristics and to determine if the anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies retain their neutralizing&#xD;
      capacity over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the seriousness of the global health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the&#xD;
      difficulty of covering the world population with effective vaccination, two questions arise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the antibodies made by a patient neutralizing and do they protect the individual&#xD;
           from further contamination?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the persistence of the antibodies over time according to the clinical&#xD;
           presentation, knowing that the very symptomatic forms have developed a much higher level&#xD;
           of antibodies than the forms followed only on an outpatient basis and no less severe?&#xD;
           The investigators propose a single-center, observational study including 170 patients to&#xD;
           answer the two questions, by selecting from the file of all the patients having had a&#xD;
           positive RT-PCR 3 distinct groups: severe (hospitalized), pauci-symptomatic to moderate&#xD;
           (followed in ambulatory only). Note: people living with HIV can be included in each of&#xD;
           the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the different study groups at M24 at&#xD;
           each of the sampling times (M0, M3, M6, M9, M12, M15, M18, M24) SECONDARY EVALUATION&#xD;
           CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the different groups of the study at&#xD;
           M12 and in each of the subgroups at M12 and M24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neutralizing capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to M6, M12 and M24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of CD8 (CD38 + DR +), CD4 and activated B lymphocytes in culture This will&#xD;
           make it possible to answer the question of the persistence or not of an immune response&#xD;
           over 24 months, an essential element in the event of seasonal circulation of the virus&#xD;
           in the years to come, and of the persistence or not of the neutralizing capacities of&#xD;
           these antibodies in the over time, especially when the title approaches the detection&#xD;
           threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These information will be decisive in the event of successive waves of the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      epidemic given a low level of collective immunity (&lt;10% in France at the end of 2020) in&#xD;
      order to know whether previously affected patients are durably protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of a lack of vaccine, results from this study would make it possible to select&#xD;
      candidates for vaccination from the truly non-immune population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects (125) will be randomized to one of five mouthrinses and will be asked to give a&#xD;
      saliva sample immediately before and after a 30-60 second mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be collected from subjects at 15-minute intervals thereafter up to one&#xD;
      hour (15, 30, 45 and 60 min). The saliva will be used for RT-PCR detection of Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and viral infectivity assays, along with&#xD;
      quantitative cytokine and chemokine concentration (pg/mL, Luminex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a short survey on the taste and experience of using the mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be collected at the end of salivary collection. Subjects, except&#xD;
      controls, will be provided materials and oral hygiene instruction related to daily use of&#xD;
      oral hygiene products. In the seven-day period between study visit one and study visit two,&#xD;
      subjects will be directed to brush with Colgate toothpaste (at least twice per day) and rinse&#xD;
      with the Colgate mouthrinse (according to on-label procedures). Controls are asked to carry&#xD;
      out their typical oral hygiene regimen with the products they typically use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects keep a daily diary of oral hygiene performance, product usage, COVID-19 symptoms&#xD;
      and exposures. Subjects complete study visit two one week after the baseline visit during&#xD;
      which additional salivary (1 time point, 2 mL of saliva over 5 min, no rinse) will occur and&#xD;
      blood samples collected. each subject will undergo a periodontal exam.&#xD;

      Randomized, double-blind prospective trial to test the efficacy and acceptability of&#xD;
      therapeutic, antiseptic mouth rinses to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva of SARS-CoV-2+&#xD;
      patients 18-65 years of age. The study will enroll 30 outpatient SARS-CoV-2+ subjects per&#xD;
      mouth rinse, (to achieve a total of 25 subjects with full data sets per mouth rinse,) with 5&#xD;
      mouth rinses, requiring us to enroll 125 SARS-CoV-2+ patients. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      their mouthrinse. These patients will have already had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ test prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. There will be no stratification to our randomization. All mouthrinses are&#xD;
      commercially available Colgate products and will be used according to on-label instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to a mouthrinse and will be asked to give a saliva sample&#xD;
      immediately before and after a 30-60 second mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be collected from subjects at 15-minute intervals thereafter up to one&#xD;
      hour (15, 30, 45 and 60 min). The saliva samples will be stored and used for RT-PCR detection&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 virus and viral infectivity assays, along with quantitative cytokine and&#xD;
      chemokine concentration (pg/mL, Luminex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also complete a short survey on the taste and experience of using the&#xD;
      mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be collected at the end of salivary collection. Subjects, except&#xD;
      controls, will be provided materials and oral hygiene instruction related to daily use of&#xD;
      oral hygiene products provided by the study. In the seven-day period between study visits,&#xD;
      subjects will be directed to brush with Colgate toothpaste (at least twice per day) and rinse&#xD;
      with the Colgate mouthrinse (according to on-label procedures). Controls are not given&#xD;
      Colgate products and will be asked to carry out their typical oral hygiene regimen with the&#xD;
      products they typically use. All subjects will be asked to keep a daily diary of oral hygiene&#xD;
      performance, product usage, COVID-19 symptoms and exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be scheduled to return to the research clinic at one week after the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, during which additional salivary (1 time point, 2 mL of saliva over 5 min, no&#xD;
      rinse will occur) and blood samples will be collected. At the conclusion of sample&#xD;
      collection, the subject will undergo a periodontal exam. Study participation concludes&#xD;
      following the periodontal exam at the end of the second on site study visit. Patients with&#xD;
      any periodontitis or gingivitis diagnosis will be informed of their diagnosis and will be&#xD;
      referred to an oral healthcare provider for further treatment. This study involves two&#xD;
      90-minute visits.&#xD;

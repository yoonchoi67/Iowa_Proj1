      COVID-19 infection manifests in its severe form as acute alveolo-interstitial and vascular&#xD;
      pneumonitis. However, long-term outcome remains unknown. A progression to fibrosing pneumonia&#xD;
      could affect 10 to 30% of survivors of severe forms, making it a public health problem&#xD;
      through secondary disability. The project concerns the analysis of CT images of patients&#xD;
      followed at the Avicenne APHP hospital (Bobigny) in collaboration with two expert image&#xD;
      treatment/modelling teams for an evaluation of vascular remodelling and mechanical simulation&#xD;
      of the regional lung compliance. These parameters obtained at 2-4 months of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection will be correlated with clinical, CT, and functional data at 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      follow-up. This project should make it possible to understand the COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      manifests as an acute alveolo-interstitial and vascular pneumonitis in its severe form.&#xD;
      However, long-term outcome remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that a progression to&#xD;
      fibrosing pneumonia could affect 10 to 30% of survivors of severe forms, making it a public&#xD;
      health problem through secondary disability. But there is no parameter which could currently&#xD;
      allow to predict such an outcome. The SILICOVILUNG project is based on the CT images analysis&#xD;
      of patients followed at the Avicenne APHP hospital (Bobigny, France) after severe COVID&#xD;
      pneumonitis in collaboration with two expert image treatment/modelling teams [ Artemis&#xD;
      Telecom Sud-Paris (Evry, France) and LMS INRIA Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France)] for&#xD;
      an evaluation of vascular remodeling and mechanical simulation of the regional lung&#xD;
      compliance using a poromechanical model. These parameters obtained at 2-4 months of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection will be correlated with clinical, CT, and functional data at 6 months and 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up. This project should make it possible to understand the mechanisms of regional&#xD;
      physiology in the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonias in their severe forms and to anticipate&#xD;
      the development or not of sequelae, particularly fibrosing.&#xD;

      &quot;The SILICOVILUNG project is based on the retrospective analysis of pulmonary CT images of&#xD;
      patients followed after severe COVID pneumonitis at the Avicenne APHP hospital (Bobigny,&#xD;
      France). CT series will be retrieved from the data bank of the radiology and pneumology&#xD;
      departments (Avicenne APHP hospital Bobigny, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records ( CTscan and clinical data) will be retrospectively included if they fulfilled the&#xD;
      following criteria: patients &gt; 18y with initial severe pneumonitis ( COVID-19 PCR+; oxygen&#xD;
      therapy &gt; 3L/min; at least 25% lesions on CT scan; no mechanical ventilation; not treated for&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism). Records from patients with a history of COPD and/or ILD will be&#xD;
      excluded. Records from thirty patients will be selected on data obtained at 2-4 months after&#xD;
      the initial COVID pneumonitis episode: twenty patients with significant lung lesions observed&#xD;
      on the CT at 2-4 months, ten patients with DLCO &lt;65% associated with faint pulmonary lesions&#xD;
      on the CT at 2-4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary CT images will be treated by mathematical analysis and modeling in collaboration&#xD;
      with two expert image treatment/modelling teams [ Artemis, Samovar lab Telecom Sud-Paris&#xD;
      (Evry, France) and LMS INRIA Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France)] A 3D evaluation of the&#xD;
      pulmonary small arteries remodeling/pruning will be done on multislice CT using a method&#xD;
      recently developed in collaboration with the Artemis Samovar team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4D evaluation of the local pulmonary compliances will be done using a recently developed&#xD;
      model of the lungs at the breathing time scale and the organ space based on a general&#xD;
      poromechanical formulation compatible with large strains and thermodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vascular modeling/pruning observed patterns on the 2-4-month follow-up pulmonary CT will&#xD;
      be identified, described and quantified using an order of remodeling. The poromechanical&#xD;
      observed patterns on the 2-4-month follow-up pulmonary CT models will be identified,&#xD;
      described and quantified using an order of porosity and stiffness in various regions of the&#xD;
      lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These parameters obtained at 2-4 months of COVID-19 infection will be correlated with&#xD;
      clinical, CT, and functional (DLCO) data at 6 months and 1-year of follow-up The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the identification of pulmonary vascular pruning and poromechanical patterns&#xD;
      predictive for evolutive sequalae post COVID19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be the identification and order of magnitude of pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pruning/vascular remodeling and DLCO impairment at 2-4 months and 1 year post initial COVID&#xD;
      pneumonitis &quot;&#xD;

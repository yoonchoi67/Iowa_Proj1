  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to assess the amplitude and quality of the vaccine response&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2, defined here by its characteristics established at 3 months, and its&#xD;
      persistence over time, defined here at 9 months, in subjects residing in medical&#xD;
      establishment for dependent elderly persons, compared to immunocompetent subjects aged 40 to&#xD;
      65 years (control subjects for vaccination over the same period).&#xD;

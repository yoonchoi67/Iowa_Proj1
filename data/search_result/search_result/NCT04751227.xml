  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been well documented that patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are susceptible to&#xD;
      developing neurocognitive and musculoskeletal complications because of various factors,&#xD;
      including the nature of the critical illness, medications, over-sedation, and pain.&#xD;
      Neuro-stimulants are used to speed up physical and mental processes through the increase in&#xD;
      neurotransmitter, which translates into increase in arousal, wakefulness, attention, memory,&#xD;
      mental and motor processing speed. The investigators reviewed the literature and described&#xD;
      the clinical characteristics for a case series of adult patients admitted to COVID and&#xD;
      non-COVID ICU between January 2017 and June 2020, who received modafinil to promote&#xD;
      wakefulness and improve cognition at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre&#xD;
      (KFSH&amp;RC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The secondary goals to describe the change of Glasgow Coma&#xD;
      Scale (GCS) before and after the start of modafinil therapy, ICU and hospital length of stay,&#xD;
      discharge disposition, adverse drug effects, and mortality rate.&#xD;

    <time_frame>48 hours before modafinil therapy and 7 days after modafinil therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Describe the median change in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) before and after modafinil therapy. The GCS is used to assess and communicate changes in mental status and to measure the duration of coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale is comprised of the individual components, e.g. &quot;eye(4) verbal(5) motor (6)&quot;. Glasgow Coma Score is calculated by addition of the total points selected under each component (eye, verbal, motor) score can range from 1 and 15</description>

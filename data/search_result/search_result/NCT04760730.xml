      A Phase I/II Single-Blinded Randomised Safety and Immunogenicity Study in Adults of AZD1222&#xD;
      and rAd26-S Administered as Heterologous Prime Boost Regimen for the Prevention of COVID-19&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single blinded randomised clinical study, designed to provide data on&#xD;
      the heterologous prime boost use of AZD1222 and rAd26-S, to be administered one after the&#xD;
      other interchangeably. This study aims to explore the immunogenicity and safety of combining&#xD;
      these 2 different adenovirus vector vaccines in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be healthy adults ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a parallel group treatment study with 2 groups and single blinded (participant&#xD;
      blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised (1:1) to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: 1 intramuscular (IM) injection AZD1222 on Day 1 followed by rAd26-S on Day 29&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: 1 IM injection of rAd26-S on Day 1 followed by AZD1222 on Day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will remain on study for 6 months (180 days) following the first&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity will be assessed for the duration of the study, including serologic&#xD;
      quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen&#xD;
      specific antibody levels and antibody seroconversion rate, neutralising antibody assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed for the duration of the study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Solicited adverse events (AEs; local and systemic) will be assessed for 7 days following&#xD;
           each vaccination (Day 1 through Day 7 for first vaccination and Day 29 through Day 35&#xD;
           for second vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsolicited AEs will be recorded for 29 days following each vaccination (ie, until Day&#xD;
           29 following the first vaccination and Day 57 following the second vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from signing of the informed consent form&#xD;
           through Day 180. However, the safety endpoint for SAEs will be assessed after the first&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be recorded from first vaccination&#xD;
           through Day 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is going to be conducted in the United Arab Emirates. An appropriate number of&#xD;
      participants will be screened to achieve approximately 100 evaluable participants.&#xD;

      Introduction Although there is as yet no scientific evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 virus&#xD;
      infection could have negative effects on fertility, currently the possibility that the virus&#xD;
      could affect sperm function and egg performance cannot be excluded. Previous studies have&#xD;
      already shown an association between influenza and infertility. SARS-CoV-2 seems to be far&#xD;
      more aggressive in terms of severe illness, morbidity and mortality in comparison to common&#xD;
      influenzas, thus it is reasonable to hypothesize a possible substantial effect of Covid-19 on&#xD;
      fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the cellular level, common influenza viruses promote oxidant-sensitive pathways, leading&#xD;
      to increased oxidative stress. This mechanism has been blamed to cause male infertility&#xD;
      through a reduction of progressive motility in spermatozoa and a simultaneous increase in&#xD;
      sperm DNA fragmentation. Based on this pathogenic pathway, it can be hypothesized that&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 could increase sperm DNA fragmentation, which might affect fertilizing potential.&#xD;
      Along the same lines, SARS-CoV-2 may affect oocyte performance through mechanisms that&#xD;
      increase oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As SARS-CoV-2 acts through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, this was&#xD;
      proposed as an additional pathway affecting ovaria follicles and oocytes. ACE2 receptors are&#xD;
      expressed in human ovaries, while angiotensin has been detected in measurable amounts in the&#xD;
      follicular fluid . Therefore, a possible negative impact of the virus through an interaction&#xD;
      between the oocyte and the somatic cells cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic exerted tremendous pressure on scientists to develop safe and effective&#xD;
      vaccines. A few delivery systems for next-generation vaccines against COVID-19 were&#xD;
      introduced. The new-generation vaccines include only a specific antigen or antigens of the&#xD;
      pathogen, instead of the whole pathogen, thus providing a better safety profile. While&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 has four main structural proteins, the spike protein (S) which is located at the&#xD;
      outer surface of the virus particles and can bind to ACE2 on the cell surface and causes&#xD;
      receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus, is the main target to evoke the self-immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mRNA vaccines represent the newest generation of vaccines in which all components can be&#xD;
      engineered via chemical synthesis. Due to the mRNA molecules' low apparent transfection&#xD;
      efficacy, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are often used to incorporate the mRNA molecules for&#xD;
      transfection purposes. An additional advantage of the mRNA vaccine is that the antigen&#xD;
      expression generated by the mRNA is a transient process and therefore the risk of host DNA&#xD;
      integration is negligible. Furthermore, elimination of live materials poses an advantage from&#xD;
      a quality control standpoint and allows quick product switching in manufacturing facilities.&#xD;
      Since the process is fully-synthetic it also eliminates the risk of disease transmissions&#xD;
      from the manufacturing facility. The effect of the systemic generation and introduction of&#xD;
      just the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 could have a negative influence on ovarian follicles and&#xD;
      oocytes has not been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti Mullarian Hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein produced by the granulosa cells of the antral&#xD;
      follicles. Its circulating levels are associated with the fertility state of the ovary and in&#xD;
      contrast to other hormones are not influenced by the state of the menstrual cycle. Therefore,&#xD;
      AMH levels are considered the measurement of choice for estimating ovarian reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Israel is the first country to widely vaccinate its population using the mRNA vaccines and&#xD;
      due to all the aforementioned, the aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the mRNA&#xD;
      vaccines on ovarian reserve estimated by the change in AMH before and three-month following&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods This is a prospective study including reproductive age women (age 18 to&#xD;
      42) that are planning to be vaccinated in Israel. Women will be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study while visiting the ambulatory vaccinating clinics before&#xD;
      being vaccinated. Medical information will be collected by the research team during this&#xD;
      visit. Women visiting other ambulatory clinics, which are not planning to be vaccinated will&#xD;
      be asked to participate as controls. Blood samples will be collected for AMH analysis before&#xD;
      administration of the first mRNA vaccine shot and 3 months following the second vaccine shot.&#xD;
      An internet questionnaire will be sent following one year from vaccination regarding&#xD;
      gynecological and obstetrical outcomes.&#xD;

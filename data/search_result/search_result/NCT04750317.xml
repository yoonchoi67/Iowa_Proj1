    <textblock>
      TOFA-COV-2 is a cohort study of the efficacy of tofacitinib in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and/or death in patients with moderately severe COVID-19 pneumonia who&#xD;
      received standard of care treatment (SoC). The study population consists of adults (≥18&#xD;
      years) with COVID-19, who are admitted to the university hospitals and don't require invasive&#xD;
      or noninvasive ventilation on admission. All patients are divided into four groups depending&#xD;
      on nadir levels of oxygen saturation and therapy: (1) patients with oxygen saturation ≤93%&#xD;
      who received tofacitinib and SoC, (2) patients with oxygen saturation ≤93% who received only&#xD;
      SoC, (3) patients with oxygen saturation &gt;93% who received tofacitinib and SoC, (4) patients&#xD;
      with oxygen saturation &gt;93% who received only SoC. The aim of the study is to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that addition of tofacitinib to SoC could reduce the risk of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and/or death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TOFA-COV-2 is a cohort study that is conducted in the three clinics of the Sechenov&#xD;
      University (Moscow, Russia) in patients with moderately severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A&#xD;
      diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia suspected clinically was confirmed by polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR) and/or chest CT. In patients with inconclusive or negative results of&#xD;
      PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia was defined as an acute respiratory&#xD;
      infection with typical CT findings (4 or 5 on CO-RADS scale) and no other obvious aetiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be included in this study, patients must have COVID-19 pneumonia involving at&#xD;
      least 25% of lung tissue in combination with at least one of the following: (1) oxygen&#xD;
      saturation at rest ≤93% on ambient air, (2) increased C-reactive protein (CRP ≥50 mg/L)&#xD;
      and/or (3) fever (≥38.0°C) that persisted for at least two days despite treatment with&#xD;
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or paracetamol. Exclusion criteria for the administration&#xD;
      of tofacitinib were coexistent infection other than COVID-19; requirement for invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation; estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using CKD-EPI formula&#xD;
      ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2; elevated ALT and/or AST levels more than 3 times the upper limit of&#xD;
      normal; chronic use of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive agents; and administration of&#xD;
      interleukin-6 inhibitors and/or high-dose glucocorticoids (≥250 mg prednisone equivalent&#xD;
      intravenously) for the treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are divided into four groups depending on nadir levels of oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      therapy: (1) patients with oxygen saturation ≤93% who received tofacitinib and SoC, (2)&#xD;
      patients with oxygen saturation ≤93% who received only SoC, (3) patients with oxygen&#xD;
      saturation &gt;93% who received tofacitinib and SoC, (4) patients with oxygen saturation &gt;93%&#xD;
      who received only SoC. The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that administration of&#xD;
      tofacitinib could influence the risk of mechanical ventilation and/or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients provided written, informed consent for the off-label use of experimental&#xD;
      medications, including tofacitinib, according to the provisional recommendations issued by&#xD;
      the Russian Ministry of Health during the outbreak of infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that will prospectively record and monitor responses and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of patients with cancer after covid-19 vaccination, including measurements&#xD;
      of antibody titers in serum and also record potential factors that affect immunity, such as&#xD;
      type and stage of cancer, type and time of systemic therapy in relation to covid-19&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well recognised that patients with cancer are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19&#xD;
      disease and should be at high prioritisation for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In Greece&#xD;
      the vaccination of healthcare workers has been initiated in January 2021, elderly citizens as&#xD;
      well and for cancer patients of all ages will be initiated early February 2021. There are&#xD;
      very little available data on the efficacy of immunisation with vaccines overall in cancer&#xD;
      patients, with most existing data involving the influenza vaccine. The covid-19 vaccine&#xD;
      trials have not included cancer patients, therefore, the efficacy and duration of immunity in&#xD;
      patients with cancer are still unknown. Those patients are often immunocompromised due to&#xD;
      their disease or the side-effects of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above this study was designed to prospectively record and monitor patients with&#xD;
      cancer after covid-19 vaccination. The study will record and measure clinical outcomes, such&#xD;
      as possible infection from covid-19 despite vaccination, severity and mortality, but also&#xD;
      possible side effects post vaccination. Within the study serological responses (IgG antibody&#xD;
      titers) will also be monitored in three timepoints (prior to vaccination, one month and three&#xD;
      months after completion of the two doses of vaccination). Potential factors that affect&#xD;
      immunity, will be recorded, such as type and stage of cancer, type and time of systemic&#xD;
      therapy in relation to covid-19 vaccination.&#xD;

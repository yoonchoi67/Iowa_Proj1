  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests an adaptation of the HIV Continuum of Prevention, Care, and Treatment&#xD;
      Framework (CoPCT) for use in tracking COVID-19 testing and follow-up in a medically and&#xD;
      socially vulnerable population. This study uses an integrated research collaborative&#xD;
      framework that facilitates dialogue among researchers, community members, and service&#xD;
      providers as a tool for optimizing the adaptive intervention and will take place at the North&#xD;
      Jersey Community Research Initiative (NJCRI)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to optimize an adaptive&#xD;
      intervention that successfully navigates COVID-19 medically or socially vulnerable people&#xD;
      through a continuum of prevention, care and treatment (CoPCT) modeled on the HIV CoPCT. The&#xD;
      COVID-19 CoPCT starts with testing and continues with successful adherence to prevention or&#xD;
      treatment guidelines to help prevent and/or treat COVID-19. The study will assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Navigation Services compared to referrals in increasing COVID-19 testing and&#xD;
      Brief Counseling in increasing adherence to the State of NJ recommendations for COVID-19&#xD;
      prevention and treatment. The study will also examine the effect of Critical Dialogue on&#xD;
      testing behavior among people who decline to be tested for COVID-19. The investigators will&#xD;
      develop decision rules about what evidence-based-interventions work best for what types of&#xD;
      people (e.g., those who test right away, versus decliners) and in what period of the COVID-19&#xD;
      continuum. Finally, the study will shed light on factors associated with testing and&#xD;
      adherence to NJ recommendations. Investigators will follow Community Based Participatory&#xD;
      Research principles in implementing a sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial&#xD;
      (SMART) design. Adjusting for possible 15% loss to follow-up, a total sample of 670 people&#xD;
      who are medically and socially vulnerable to infection and poor outcomes with COVID-19 will&#xD;
      be enrolled as the intent-to treat-sample. The investigators are confident that they can&#xD;
      recruit this sample in Essex County, NJ based on their previous experience and because the&#xD;
      parent study research team has established relationships with other service agencies in the&#xD;
      community from which, in addition to NJCRI, research participants will be drawn. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is completion of the COVID-19 test within one week of the first intervention session&#xD;
      The study will include 3 stages in which participants will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      possible interventions as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligible and consenting participants will be randomized to receive the first-stage&#xD;
           intervention: Navigation Services (NS) or standard services (referral to testing and NJ&#xD;
           digital information brochure after testing). The primary outcome is completion of the&#xD;
           COVID-19 test within one week of the intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Those who get tested will be randomized to receive the second-stage intervention:&#xD;
           continue with NS or standard treatment or switch to Brief Counseling (BC). The outcome&#xD;
           will be adherence to NJ recommendations. For those testing positive, adherence means&#xD;
           engaging in a 14-day quarantine, receiving medical care as needed and contact tracing.&#xD;
           For those testing negative, adherence means social distancing and wearing masks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Those who do not get tested will be randomized into their second-stage intervention to&#xD;
           continue with NS or digital brochure or switch to Critical Dialogue (CD). The outcome&#xD;
           will be completing COVID-19 testing within 1 week of the second stage intervention&#xD;
           session. Those who complete the testing will then be randomized to either continue with&#xD;
           NS or digital brochure or switch to BC. Those who do not get tested will be randomized&#xD;
           to continued NS or digital brochure or switch to CD. The outcome will be adherence to NJ&#xD;
           recommendations, as defined above. All variables will be measured using standardized&#xD;
           measures selected from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) PhenX Toolkit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary aim of comparing effects of Navigation Services versus referral on testing&#xD;
      behavior and NJ recommendations adherence, using standard sample size formula for difference&#xD;
      of two proportions, a total sample size of 582 subjects is needed to have 80% power at Î±=0.05&#xD;
      to detect a 10% difference in proportions, assuming 70% in the referral group will complete&#xD;
      testing and adhere to specific NJ recommendations. The 582 sample size has 85% to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 15% in adherence rates to NJ recommendations between two interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Navigation services include assessment and support with service referrals. Each participant will meet with a peer navigator in person or on Zoom Conferencing for 30 minutes to go over results from their social and health needs assessment that is retrieved from the baseline assessment.

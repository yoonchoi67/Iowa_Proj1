      This study will determine the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on quality of life, body&#xD;
      composition and respiratory function in patients with a history of COVID-19.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared, causing a wide range of&#xD;
      symptoms, mainly respiratory infection. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly over&#xD;
      several months, affecting patients across all age groups and geographic areas. The disease&#xD;
      has a diverse course; patients may range from asymptomatic to those with respiratory failure,&#xD;
      complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on&#xD;
      quality of life, body composition and respiratory function in patients with a history of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients after COVID-19 will be included in the pulmonary rehabilitation protocol. The&#xD;
      duration of rehabilitation will depend on the patient's condition: from 7 to 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, BC-420 MA, Tanita)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight, height and BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  spirometry (Spirometr PNEUMO, abcMED)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (LUNGTEST 1000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morphology (CRP, D-Dimer, WBC) and gasometry (pCO2, pO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chest computed tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These parameters will be recorded before the first day of rehabilitation (baseline), after&#xD;
      completion of rehabilitation protocol, and three months after completion the rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol. A change in evaluated parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, interventional, non-randomized study. All patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled by Podkarpackie Center for Lung Diseases in Rzeszów.&#xD;

    <description>Comparison of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire mean between baseline, immediately after the end of the rehabilitation protocol, and 3 months after the end of the rehabilitation protocol. The questionnaire consists of 26 questions. Answers are awarded a score in a five-point scale (1-5). Answer scores are calculated according to the WHOQOL-BREF algorithm in the range of 0-100 points. Higher score corresponds to higher quality of life.</description>

    <description>Pulmonary rehabilitation will include: early mobilization with frequent posture changes and simple exercises in bed taking into account the patient's respiratory tract. Respiratory physiotherapy will also include improving diaphragm function along with training additional respiratory muscles. Active exercises of the upper limbs will be accompanied by gradual muscle strengthening. Aerobic regeneration will be carried out by walking along the hospital corridor, stationary bike and climbing stairs. Body balance therapy in closed systems in front of the mirror will also be included. After kinesiotherapy, the session will end with a vibration massage and relaxation of the whole body. Motivational breathing training will be used every 2 hours, 7 days a week, performed independently by the patient in the ward room. The physiotherapy process will be carried out 6 times a week and lasts 30-45 minutes a day. The duration of rehabilitation depends on the patient's condition: from 7 to 14 days.</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to assess effectiveness of Sinovac's&#xD;
      Adsorbed COVID-19 (Inactivated) vaccine. Residents in the urban area of a municipality are&#xD;
      eligible to participate. The city was divided in clusters and those cluster were grouped to&#xD;
      determine the offer of vaccination in four steps. The vaccine will be offered to adults (18&#xD;
      years old and above) according to the location of their homes in a cluster. The vaccine&#xD;
      schedule is two doses with four-weeks interval. Baseline samples to determine previous&#xD;
      immunity will be collected before vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of COVID-19 reported in the city will be recorded according to the WHO clinical&#xD;
      progression scale. Comparison of periods before and after vaccination and relation to&#xD;
      immunization coverage will be considered for the assessment of effectiveness in the clusters&#xD;
      and groups of clusters.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Evidence of uncontrolled neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease,&#xD;
             according to anamnesis or physical examination. Significant changes in treatment or&#xD;
             hospitalizations due to worsening of the condition in the last three months are&#xD;
             indicators of uncontrolled disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diseases with impaired immune system including: neoplasms (except basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma), congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases not&#xD;
             controlled according to anamnesis or physical examination. Significant changes in&#xD;
             treatment or hospitalizations due to worsening of the condition in the last three&#xD;
             months are indicators of uncontrolled disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Behavioral, cognitive or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or his or her representative physician, affects the participant's ability&#xD;
             to understand and cooperate with all study protocol requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any alcohol or drug abuse over the 12 months prior to enrollment in the study that has&#xD;
             caused medical, professional or family problems, indicated by clinical history;&#xD;

             components thereof;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of asplenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational product in the six&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment in the study or planned participation in another clinical&#xD;
             trial within the two years following enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous participation in a study to evaluate a COVID-19 vaccine or prior exposure to&#xD;
             a COVID-19 vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Use of immunosuppressant therapy regimens within the six months prior to enrollment in&#xD;
             the study for planned use within the two years following enrollment. Immunosuppressant&#xD;
             therapy regimens include: antineoplastic chemotherapy, radiation therapy and&#xD;
             immunosuppressants to induce transplant tolerance, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids within the three months prior to the&#xD;

             within the three months following enrollment in the study. Immunosuppressive doses of&#xD;
             corticosteroids will be considered the equivalent prednisone 20 mg/day for adults, for&#xD;
             longer than one week. Continued use of topical or nasal corticosteroids is not&#xD;
             considered an immunosuppressant;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Received blood products (transfusions or immunoglobulins) within the three months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study, or planned administration of blood products or&#xD;
             immunoglobulins within the two years following enrollment in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Suspected or confirmed fever within the 72 hours prior to vaccination or axillary&#xD;
             temperature greater than 37.8 °C* on the day of vaccination (enrollment may be&#xD;
             postponed until participant has gone 72 hours without fever);&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 on the day of vaccination (vaccination can be&#xD;
             postponed until the participant completes 72 hours without symptoms or the diagnosis&#xD;
             is ruled out);&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Received live attenuated virus vaccine or inactivated vaccine within the 28 days or 14&#xD;
             days, respectively, prior to enrollment in the study, or immunization planned within&#xD;
             the 28 days after enrollment in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. History of bleeding disorder (e.g. factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet&#xD;
             disorder), or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM&#xD;
             injections or venipuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator or his/her&#xD;
             representative physician, could put the safety/rights of potential participants at&#xD;
             risk or prevent them from complying with this protocol.&#xD;

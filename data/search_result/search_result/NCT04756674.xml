  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 infection and the huge impact it has had&#xD;
      upon lives in the UK, it is key to increase knowledge on the impact of the virus on the body.&#xD;
      Certain aspects of the virus' characteristics are also poorly understood: The reason behind&#xD;
      the variation in response between individuals, and the long-term impacts of infection upon&#xD;
      the body. It is already known from previous research that muscle-health plays an important&#xD;
      role in health, with other illnesses known to have an impact upon muscle health. A large&#xD;
      number of studies have investigated the relationship between muscle and health, with an&#xD;
      increasing focus upon the impact upon the mitochondria within the muscle cells. Mitochondria&#xD;
      are the energy-producing component of a cell and are vital not just for the muscle-cells but&#xD;
      for the body as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hope that by investigating the impact of COVID-19 infection upon human&#xD;
      skeletal muscle, the question of why individuals have different responses to the infection&#xD;
      and the mechanism of the longer-term impact of infection can be answered. This added&#xD;
      knowledge will then, hopefully, be able to guide therapy targets in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, there have been over 50,000 deaths and&#xD;
      over 1million infections in the UK alone. It has been widely reported that infection with&#xD;
      COVID-19 leads to large variation between individuals, a large number appear asymptomatic or&#xD;
      mild flu-like symptoms compared to a percentage requiring intensive care support and for&#xD;
      some, the infection is ultimately fatal. The reason behind this variation is not yet fully&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With COVID-19 likely to have a lasting impact within the UK and on the NHS, any research that&#xD;
      improves our knowledge upon the effect of the infection has the possibility to improve&#xD;
      therapy targets and hopefully improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With how novel the COVID-19 pathogen is, little is currently known about the potential&#xD;
      long-term impacts of infection upon individuals. There are currently many reports of&#xD;
      longer-term syndromes following infection with COVID-19 including loss of smell and myalgia.&#xD;
      The researchers hope that investigating the impact upon patients over the 12-months following&#xD;
      their infection will gather information on the long-term impacts and potentially find&#xD;
      evidence of the reason for these longer-term symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With skeletal muscle being one of the largest components of the human body, any impact upon&#xD;
      its function is likely to have a significant impact upon an individual. With it being vital&#xD;
      for not only locomotion but also in energy production for the body. The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that changes within the skeletal muscle may account for some of the impacts of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. The investigators hope that by investigating changes in muscle structure,&#xD;
      muscle mitochondrial function, and neurological supply to the muscle they can identify a&#xD;
      future therapy target to improve outcomes from COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this, this study plans to recruit participants with confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      infection requiring varying levels of oxygen support (Oxygen therapy only n=12, Non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation n=12) and a control group of non-covid community-acquired pneumonia requiring&#xD;
      oxygen therapy (n=12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will undergo the same investigations, and no interventions will form part of the&#xD;
      study. Investigations will be carried out at 24-72hours of acute hospital admission, with&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 6-months and 12-months post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments performed will include: muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle, an&#xD;
      ultrasound scan of the vastus lateralis muscle, voluntary and stimulated iEMG of VL, and&#xD;
      hand-grip strength analysis.&#xD;

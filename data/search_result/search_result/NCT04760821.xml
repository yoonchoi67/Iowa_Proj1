      Acute myocardial injury has been a finding of variable frequency among patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19. It is now recognized that cTnI levels are strongly associated with increased&#xD;
      mortality. The mechanisms underlying the myocardial injury remain unknown, and it is not&#xD;
      clear whether they reflect local/systemic inflammatory process and/or cellular ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both myocardial ischemia and ventricular dysfunction result in dramatic changes in&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. These changes involve an increase in the rate of&#xD;
      cytoplasmic anaerobic glycolysis to compensate for the decrease in mitochondrial ATP&#xD;
      production. The rest of the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism originates mainly from the&#xD;
      β-oxidation of free fatty acids, which occurs at the expense of glucose oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimetazidine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-ketoacyl CoA long-chain thiolase&#xD;
      (3-KAT), the last enzyme involved in the oxidation of fatty acids. Stimulation of glucose&#xD;
      oxidation by trimetazidine results in a better coupling between glycolysis and glucose&#xD;
      oxidation, with a consequent decrease in lactate production and intracellular acidosis,&#xD;
      present in situations of myocardial ischemia or heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the PREMIER-COVID-19 study was designed to test the hypothesis that the use of&#xD;
      trimetazidine associated with usual therapy in patients admitted with a diagnosis of moderate&#xD;
      to severe acute respiratory syndrome by SARS-CoV2 infection reduces the extent of acute&#xD;
      myocardial injury assessed by the peak release of ultra-sensitive troponin compared to usual&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial injury, defined by increased levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I&#xD;
      (cTnI), has been a finding of variable frequency among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. This&#xD;
      myocardial impairment can occur in the form of acute myocarditis or an injury secondary to&#xD;
      the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand (type 2 myocardial infarction). It is now&#xD;
      recognized that cTnI levels are strongly associated with increased mortality. The mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the myocardial injury remain unknown, and it is not clear whether they reflect&#xD;
      local/systemic inflammatory process and/or cellular ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both myocardial ischemia and ventricular dysfunction result in dramatic changes in&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. These changes involve an increase in the rate of&#xD;
      cytoplasmic anaerobic glycolysis to compensate for the decrease in mitochondrial ATP&#xD;
      production. Unfortunately, the increase in glycolysis exceeds the subsequent mitochondrial&#xD;
      oxidation capacity of pyruvate (glucose oxidation) derived from glycolysis, resulting in the&#xD;
      intracellular accumulation of lactate and protons. The protons produced from this decoupling&#xD;
      between glycolysis and glucose oxidation contribute to a rupture in ionic homeostasis and&#xD;
      myocardial cells, resulting in lower cardiac efficiency. In both the ischemic heart and the&#xD;
      insufficient heart, the rest of the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism originates mainly from&#xD;
      the β-oxidation of free fatty acids, which occurs at the expense of glucose oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimetazidine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-ketoacyl CoA long-chain thiolase&#xD;
      (3-KAT), the last enzyme involved in the oxidation of fatty acids. Stimulation of glucose&#xD;
      oxidation by trimetazidine results in a better coupling between glycolysis and glucose&#xD;
      oxidation, with a consequent decrease in lactate production and intracellular acidosis,&#xD;
      present in situations of myocardial ischemia or heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the PREMIER-COVID-19 study (open and randomized) was designed to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the use of trimetazidine associated with usual therapy in patients admitted with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of moderate to severe acute respiratory syndrome by SARS-CoV2 infection reduces the&#xD;
      extent of acute myocardial injury assessed by the peak release of ultra-sensitive troponin&#xD;
      compared to usual therapy. We will also assess, as secondary outcomes, other biomarkers of&#xD;
      severity (BNP, CK-MB, D-dimer, prothrombin time and platelet count) and the impact on&#xD;
      clinical evolution to more severe forms (need for intensive care treatment, time total&#xD;
      hospitalization and in-hospital mortality).&#xD;

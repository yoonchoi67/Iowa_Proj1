      This nested project of the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort (SMSC) is to assess the severity&#xD;
      of COVID-19 and the magnitude of antibody response after infection with Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients already treated or not with&#xD;
      various immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis followed in the framework of the SMSC.&#xD;

      This nested project of the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort (SMSC) is to assess the severity&#xD;
      of COVID-19 and the magnitude of antibody response after infection with Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients already treated or not with&#xD;
      various immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis followed in the framework of the SMSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated symptoms in the&#xD;
      study population, data is collected from systematic questioning during the SMSC-visits and&#xD;
      from serum samples collected every 6-12 months within the SMSC (for measurement of&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pre-pandemic reference samples and prospectively to determine&#xD;
      the anti-SARS-CoV-2-serostatus during the study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining the information on anti-SARS- CoV-2 serostatus and infection history opens the&#xD;
      opportunity to determine the number of patients without or with only mild vs. moderate to&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 symptoms in large groups of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treated&#xD;
      with immunotherapies targeting various components of the immune system.&#xD;

        This study is a nested project within the framework of the SMSC. The SMSC is a prospective&#xD;
        multicenter cohort study performed across eight swiss centres. Patients are recruited in&#xD;
        the SMSC according to a set of inclusion criteria as specified in the cohort protocol and&#xD;
        are only included after a written informed consent is signed.&#xD;

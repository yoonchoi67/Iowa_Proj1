  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a PCORI-funded project on HIV and aging engagement that was co-led by the study team, the&#xD;
      topics of isolation and depressions were identified as priority areas of deep concern among&#xD;
      older PLWH. The COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the urgency to test interventions to mitigate&#xD;
      depression and isolation among older PLWH. However, there is scant evidence on effective&#xD;
      interventions that help mitigate depression and isolation among older PLWH. While physical&#xD;
      distancing and stay at home orders are a necessary strategy to flatten the curve, ease&#xD;
      pressure on the healthcare system, and protect the most vulnerable, the order further&#xD;
      increases the isolation faced by people aging with HIV, and creates barriers to accessing&#xD;
      medications, health services, and other resources. This project will include 6 virtual focus&#xD;
      groups and 12 individual interviews with adults ages 50 or older in California (Palm Spring,&#xD;
      Los Angeles) and the Tampa-Bay region, Florida to (1): further characterize issues related to&#xD;
      depression, isolation, and basic needs of people aging with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      (2) utilizing results from Aim 1, co-develop ideas for what to include in a virtual village,&#xD;
      and (3) create and pilot the virtual village in a group of people aging with HIV. The overall&#xD;
      goal of this study is to execute an innovative solution to address issues related to&#xD;
      isolation for older PLWH which have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

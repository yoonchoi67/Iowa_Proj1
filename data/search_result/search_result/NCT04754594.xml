  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 30 µg of BNT162b2 or placebo administered in 2&#xD;
      doses, 21 days apart, in approximately 4000 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older&#xD;
      vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive&#xD;
      BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 2 portion of the study will include approximately 350 pregnant women randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) at 27 to 34 weeks' gestation. IRC review of safety&#xD;
      data through 7 days after the second dose for all Phase 2 participants will be completed&#xD;
      before participants in the Phase 3 portion can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 3 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      BNT162b2 among pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal participants who originally received placebo will receive BNT162b2 at defined time&#xD;
      points as part of the study.&#xD;

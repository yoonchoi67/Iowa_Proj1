  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to study the use and application of a point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      Covid-19 test developed by Spartan BioSciences and recently approved for clinical use by&#xD;
      Health Canada. Phase I of this study will determine the best route for the swabs (nasal,&#xD;
      throat, or both), and to determine if this POC test results are comparable to the standard&#xD;
      core-lab test results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, testing for COVID-19 is carried out with swabs and blood tests that are sent to&#xD;
      hospital laboratories for analysis. With the current technology, the turnaround time for test&#xD;
      results may take any where from 8 hours up to several days for confirmation of whether you&#xD;
      have COVID-19. This delay in diagnosis may delay care, prevent other testing modalities,&#xD;
      consume isolation beds and deplete the valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) needed&#xD;
      while providing treatment for patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a new, Health Canada approved technology, we can conduct the virus genetic testing at&#xD;
      the bedside with a nostril and throat swab, with results in under 45 minutes. This new&#xD;
      &quot;point-of-care (POC)&quot; technology, if proven accurate, may help future patients receive faster&#xD;
      and more definitive treatment. At the same time, it might help health care teams to preserve&#xD;
      resources and optimize care for patients (example: triage use of intensive care or isolation&#xD;
      unit beds, determine need for PPE, get quarantined staff back to front line to help with care&#xD;
      if they are non-carriers).&#xD;

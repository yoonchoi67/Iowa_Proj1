      To test competing sets of information for consumers on how to interpret hypothetical&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 home test kit results and whether they report plans to take CDC-recommended&#xD;
      actions to protect themselves and others given their test results and two critical aspects of&#xD;
      their clinical context: symptoms, recent close exposures. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either information from the FDA authorized Ellume home test kit (the first kit&#xD;
      authorized for over the counter use) for what actions to take for a negative or positive&#xD;
      COVID-19 test (usual care) or a decision science-based design of similar length&#xD;

      To test competing sets of information for consumers on how to interpret hypothetical&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 home test kit results and whether they report plans to take CDC [Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control]-recommended actions to protect themselves and others given their test&#xD;
      results and two critical aspects of their clinical context: symptoms, recent close exposures.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either information from the FDA authorized Ellume&#xD;
      home test kit (the first kit authorized for over the counter use) for what actions to take&#xD;
      for a negative or positive COVID-19 test (usual care) or a decision science-based design of&#xD;
      similar length (intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either information from the FDA authorized Ellume&#xD;
      home test kit for what actions to take for a negative or positive COVID-19 test (usual care)&#xD;
      or a decision science-based design of similar length (intervention). They will be given time&#xD;
      to read the documents and the opportunity to download a full &quot;instructions for use&quot; document&#xD;
      (the FDA authorized for the ELLUME test kit). They will then be randomized to one of four&#xD;
      conditions, asking them to imagine a clinical context: a person with no symptoms and no close&#xD;
      COVID-19 contact, no symptoms and close contact,&#xD;

    <description>According to the test's FDA-authorized label, a clinical study conducted in the USA in 2020 showed that the test &quot;correctly identified 96% of positive samples and 100% of negative samples in patients with symptoms.

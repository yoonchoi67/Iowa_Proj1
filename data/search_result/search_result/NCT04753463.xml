      The aim of study is to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on ophthalmology training&#xD;
      programs among residents. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its kind in&#xD;
      Poland. The impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmology training programs is largely unknown as there&#xD;
      are only few studies assessing the above issue from the resident's point of view.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was&#xD;
      first identified at the end of the year 2019 in Wuhan (China). A rapid spread of the disease&#xD;
      resulted in global threat to public health. On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) announced the state of pandemic. In Poland, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was&#xD;
      reported on 4 March 2020 and subsequent growing number of patients has placed tremendous&#xD;
      strain on healthcare system. The crisis situation prompted immediate action to divert&#xD;
      healthcare resources for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and to limit the spread of&#xD;
      the infection. In accordance with the decision of the Minister of Health of March 13th, 2020,&#xD;
      more than twenty hospitals were established to admit only the SARS-CoV-2 affected patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, all hospitals were recommended to limit their planned activity and to perform only&#xD;
      urgent and emergency services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that those changes in healthcare system and restrictions&#xD;
      established in public area during pandemic caused significant difficulties in residency&#xD;
      training considering clinical and surgical practice as well as didactic activities. In spite&#xD;
      of gradual reopening the routine services over the last few months, social distancing rules&#xD;
      are still in force. Accordingly, different methods of virtual teaching were introduced&#xD;
      including, inter alia, organisation of courses, lectures and conferences in form of on-line&#xD;
      meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of current study is to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on ophthalmology training&#xD;
      programs among residents. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its kind in&#xD;
      Poland. The impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmology training programs is largely unknown as there&#xD;
      are only few studies assessing the above issue from the resident's point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this investigations will address this gap in the literature&#xD;
      and could be used to initiate the new solutions in order to maintain successful residency&#xD;
      training during pandemic. Opinions regarding the efficiency of e-learning methods and on-line&#xD;
      meetings may be crucial to innovate the conventional teaching way permanently in the future.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>the opinion on impact for mental health among residents assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). PHQ-9 is a selfreport measure that is used to assess the severity of depression over the prior 2 weeks. Response to the nine questions are graded as 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days), and 3 (nearly every day). The total score of PHQ-9 that categorizes depression is as follows: minimal/no depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10-14), or severe depression (15-21).</description>

    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a SK SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      recombinant protein subunit vaccine (NBP2001) in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study to&#xD;
      assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a SK SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein&#xD;
      subunit vaccine (NBP2001) in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 healthy adults between 19 and 55 years of age will be enrolled and&#xD;
      block-randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of either one NBP2001 formulation (Test&#xD;
      group 1 or 2) or placebo saline (Placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the study period, participants will commonly attend 10 planned visits. Telephone calls&#xD;
      will be made 7 days after each vaccination (Day 7+3 after Visit 2 and Visit 4). However,&#xD;
      sentinel participants will be required to return at Day 7(+ 3 days) after 1st vaccination for&#xD;
      rigorous safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study vaccination will comprise 2 intramuscular injections of saline placebo, or a 30 or 50μg&#xD;
      dose of NBP2001 in an injection volume of approximately 0.5mL. The study vaccines will be&#xD;
      injected preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm at a 28-day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Halting rules based on reactogenicity and safety outcomes are defined, and enrollment and&#xD;
      study vaccination may be paused during the study if any halting rules are met.&#xD;

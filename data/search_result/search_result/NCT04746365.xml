    <textblock>
      Because ivermectin is being used to treat COVID-19 with insufficient evidence, the&#xD;
      investigator conducted a randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ivermectin in comparison to hydroxychloroquine and placebo in severe COVID-19 patients. The&#xD;
      study was conducted in Shebin-Elkom teaching hospital and recruited patients from December 6,&#xD;
      2020, to January 31, 2021.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of therapeutic agents in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19. The study is a single-center trial that will be conducted in Shebin Elkom teaching&#xD;
      hospital. The study will be a series of 3-arm comparisons between two different&#xD;
      investigational therapeutic agents (Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine) and a placebo. There&#xD;
      will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. Because&#xD;
      of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time&#xD;
      as more is learned about the successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and&#xD;
      efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data&#xD;
      and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations&#xD;
      about early study closure or changes to study arms.&#xD;

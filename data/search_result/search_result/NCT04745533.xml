  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stopping the SARS-CoV2 spread is essential to control the pandemic cause by this virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great effort is being made to carry out surveillance, case detection and contact control&#xD;
      protocols in order to detect and isolate those contagious subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects can be contagious, a surveillance system&#xD;
      based on the presence of symptoms is not enough, requiring to perform diagnostic tests in a&#xD;
      large number of subjects, such as asymptomatic contacts or high-prevalence populations, and&#xD;
      repeatedly. Moreover, the speed in obtaining results is crucial in order not to delay the&#xD;
      isolations of positive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an expensive test which requires specialized equipment&#xD;
      and personnel with a delay in results of 24-48 hours. In addition, its high sensitivity can&#xD;
      mean that subjects without infective capacity have a positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, antigen detection tests (ADTs) are cheap and easy to perform, having a result in&#xD;
      few minutes. They have shown high sensitivity and specificity in symptomatic subjects,&#xD;
      specially in the first week of symptoms when the viral load is high. This could be very&#xD;
      useful for the study of asymptomatic contacts to detect those with potential contagiousness&#xD;
      quick, easily and cheaply. However, there is no evidence to support the use of ADTs in this&#xD;
      group of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the investigators propose to carry out a study to compare the diagnostic&#xD;
      efficacy of ADTs versus PCR in the group of subjects considered to be close contacts of&#xD;
      SARS-Cov2 positive patients in the health area of Cáceres.&#xD;

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AGILE platform master protocol allows incorporation of a range of identified and&#xD;
      yet-to-be-identified candidates as potential treatments for adults with COVID-19 into the&#xD;
      trial. Candidates will be added into the trial via candidate-specific trial (CST) protocols&#xD;
      of this master protocol as appendices. Having one master protocol ensures different&#xD;
      candidates are evaluated in the same consistent manor and opening up new trials for new&#xD;
      candidates is more efficient. Inclusion of new candidates will be determined by the AGILE&#xD;
      Scientific Advisory Board based on pre-clinical data, evidence in the clinical setting and&#xD;
      GMP capabilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGILE is a multicentre, multi-arm, multi-dose, multi-stage open-label, adaptive, seamless&#xD;
      phase I/II Bayesian randomised platform trial to determine the optimal dose, activity and&#xD;
      safety of multiple candidate agents for the treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study allows for the assessment of many candidates at different doses, with the ability&#xD;
      to add candidates as they are identified or drop them as their evaluation is completed.&#xD;
      Promising candidates will move to the an external trial for further evaluation in the phase&#xD;
      II/III setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each candidate will be evaluated in its own trial, randomising between candidate and control&#xD;
      with 2:1 allocation in favour of the candidate. Each dose will be assessed for safety&#xD;
      sequentially in cohorts of 6 patients. Once a phase II dose has been identified we will&#xD;
      assess efficacy by seamlessly expanding into a larger cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGILE is completely flexible in that the core design in the master protocol (as has been&#xD;
      explained above) can be adapted for each candidate based on prior knowledge of the candidate&#xD;
      - i.e. population, primary endpoint and sample size can be amended. This will be detailed in&#xD;
      each candidate-specific trial protocol of the master protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate-Specific Trial 1 (CST-1): TBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate-Specific Trial 2 (CST-2): Open-label 2:1 randomised controlled phase I of EIDD-2801&#xD;
      versus standard of care followed by a 1:1 blinded controlled parallel group Phase II trial of&#xD;
      EIDD-2801 versus placebo. A phase I will be carried out to confirm the optimal dose in this&#xD;
      group. Following a safety review, EIDD-2801 will be tested for efficacy in a blinded placebo&#xD;
      controlled randomised phase II trial.&#xD;

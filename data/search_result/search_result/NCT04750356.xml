  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, transmission and disease severity in&#xD;
      healthcare workers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual specimens from an existing collection of samples in viral inactivating buffer and&#xD;
      derivatives and serum from the Crick COVID-19 Consortium Testing centre (Cohort A1) and&#xD;
      additional biological material collected prospectively (Cohorts A2 and B) will be used for&#xD;
      research into SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution and immune control. This testing centre is a&#xD;
      partnership between UCLH and The Francis Crick Institute to provide COVID 19 RT PCR testing&#xD;
      for healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in London Hospitals and care homes. A third group&#xD;
      (Cohort C) of the study will allow for collaborative work with other REC approved research&#xD;
      studies that have used the Crick COVID-19 Consortium Testing centre and will involve the use&#xD;
      of study samples already collected from each study to be analysed under the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      Longitudinal Study end points&#xD;

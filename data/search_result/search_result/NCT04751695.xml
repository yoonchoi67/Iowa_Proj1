      With the rapid spread of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) disease all over the world and the&#xD;
      announcement of a pandemic, research on many different drug approaches has begun and these&#xD;
      researches continue today. Although measures such as social distance, quarantine and&#xD;
      isolation are effective in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the short term during the&#xD;
      pandemic, there is no effective treatment method yet. It is known that especially healthcare&#xD;
      workers, the elderly and individuals with underlying health problems are at high risk.&#xD;
      However, gender differences in COVID-19 clinical outcomes are thought to exist, and there is&#xD;
      growing evidence that the disease is more severe in men than in women and mortality rates are&#xD;
      higher.With the global consensus that the most effective approach to control the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic is a vaccination that is effective in COVID-19, vaccines have been developed with&#xD;
      many different methods. CoronaVac vaccine (inactivated + aluminum adjuvant vaccine) is a&#xD;
      vaccine developed with the inactive method, which is the classic vaccine production method.&#xD;
      After the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of the vaccine, Phase 3 trials were&#xD;
      initiated to investigate the effectiveness of the vaccine in 4 different countries, including&#xD;
      Turkey. Emergency use approval has been given for the CoronaVac vaccine by Turkish&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. Researching the effects of vaccination on&#xD;
      oxidative stress parameters, trace element and quality of life levels in COVID-19 may provide&#xD;
      useful information in determining the effects of COVID-19 vaccine. It is thought that the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of some vitamins and trace elements may be&#xD;
      associated with positive results in COVID-19 patients, and the physiological roles of these&#xD;
      vitamins and trace elements in COVID-19 have been demonstrated by studies. It is important to&#xD;
      investigate the levels of free radicals known to be effective in the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease due to oxidative stress, which can provide information on determining&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular complications in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the quality&#xD;
      of life of individuals decreases in the COVID-19 pandemic.This study is planned to be carried&#xD;
      out by including male individuals to be vaccinated in İzmir Bakırçay University Çiğli&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital. Determination of oxidative stress parameters, trace element&#xD;
      levels and quality of life levels before and after vaccination applications to be applied to&#xD;
      individuals within the scope of the study; It was planned to compare these data before and&#xD;
      after vaccination. After analyzing the data obtained from the research with appropriate&#xD;
      statistical methods, the data will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) is a global epidemic that has serious consequences and affects&#xD;
      the world with its rapid spread and high mortality rate. The number of people infected with&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) is rapidly increasing. COVID-19&#xD;
      patients may have pneumonia, severe symptoms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      and multiple organ failure, as well as cases with no symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although social distance, quarantine and isolation are effective in reducing the spread of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in the short term during the pandemic, there is no effective treatment method yet.&#xD;
      It is known that especially healthcare workers, the elderly and individuals with underlying&#xD;
      health problems are at high risk. However, gender differences in COVID-19 clinical outcomes&#xD;
      are thought to exist, and there is growing evidence that the disease is more severe in men&#xD;
      than in women and mortality rates are higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 has led to millions of cases worldwide,&#xD;
      strengthening the global need for an effective vaccine to halt the spread of the disease and&#xD;
      reduce the number of deaths. With the global consensus that the most effective approach to&#xD;
      control the COVID-19 pandemic is a vaccination that is effective in COVID-19, many different&#xD;
      vaccines have been tested with the acceleration of vaccination studies. According to the data&#xD;
      of the World Health Organization, there are 236 vaccines in total, with clinical (63) and&#xD;
      pre-clinical (173) studies developed using 10 different methods. Types of vaccines for&#xD;
      COVID-19 include conventionally live attenuated viruses, inactivated virus protein or&#xD;
      polysaccharide conjugated subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), nucleic acid (DNA&#xD;
      and RNA), viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating), and and other vaccines consisting&#xD;
      of recombinant proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the production of virus-based vaccines takes longer than other vaccines, the immune&#xD;
      response is expected to be at a good level. Measles, mumps, Hepatitis A and chickenpox&#xD;
      vaccines are examples of vaccines developed with the virus-based method. CoronaVac vaccine&#xD;
      (inactivated + aluminum adjuvant vaccine) is a vaccine developed by the inactive method&#xD;
      (produced and inactivated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the laboratory), which is the classic&#xD;
      vaccine production method. China-based vaccine development Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Made by the&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical company named. After the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of the&#xD;
      vaccine, Phase 3 studies were initiated to investigate the effectiveness of the vaccine in 4&#xD;
      different countries, including our country. Emergency use approval has been given for the&#xD;
      CoronaVac vaccine by Turkish Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical picture of COVID-19 can be heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe&#xD;
      disease, which can be associated with a cytokine storm. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not&#xD;
      fully understood, but is likely multifactorial and, in severe cases, with a systemic&#xD;
      hyperinflammatory response and associated thromboembolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some vitamins and nutrients may be beneficial for patients infected with COVID-19 due to&#xD;
      their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Vitamins such as A, B, C, D, E and&#xD;
      folate, and trace elements such as iron, zinc, magnesium, selenium and copper play important&#xD;
      roles in supporting both innate and adaptive immune systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free radicals are continuously formed at the active site of enzymes as intermediates in&#xD;
      enzymatic reactions occurring during cell metabolism. Reactive oxygen species and reactive&#xD;
      nitrogen, known as intermediates, sometimes leak from the active site of enzymes and&#xD;
      accidentally interact with molecular oxygen and form free oxygen radicals. Lipids, proteins,&#xD;
      enzymes, carbohydrates, and DNA can be damaged due to oxidative stress, random breaks and&#xD;
      bonds in DNA chains may occur as a result of damage to membranes, damage to enzymes and&#xD;
      structural proteins may result in cell death, and these phenomena may result in cancer,&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and It constitutes the molecular&#xD;
      basis in the development of autoimmune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the quarantine measures applied, not going out and staying at home causes the person to&#xD;
      stay away from his daily routine life, the increase in the time spent at home, the pandemic&#xD;
      news that is constantly being listened to and watched cause increasing anxiety, causing both&#xD;
      changes in mood and a more sedentary life . Studies have also reported that negative&#xD;
      psychological effects such as post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger as a result&#xD;
      of quarantine have been reported. In addition, it has been said that restriction often causes&#xD;
      boredom, disappointment and a feeling of isolation. These consequences, brought about by the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affect the quality of life of individuals. During the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, it has been reported that the depression and anxiety levels of healthcare workers&#xD;
      increased and their quality of life decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare and determined and the changes of oxidative stress&#xD;
      parameters, trace element and quality of life levels in healthy men just before the first&#xD;
      dose of COVID-19 vaccine and on the 7th day after the second dose of COVID19 vaccine.&#xD;

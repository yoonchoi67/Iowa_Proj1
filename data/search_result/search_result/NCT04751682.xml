  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of three&#xD;
      groups of healthy volunteers who receive either intranasal single dose (Vaccine on Day 0 and&#xD;
      placebo on Day 28) or two-dose (vaccine on Day 0 and 28) of BBV154 vaccine or Placebo (on Day&#xD;
      0 and day 28). A total of 175 subjects will be enrolled in 2:2:1 ratio and will be conducted&#xD;
      in a double-blinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of the vaccine, each participant will record symptoms in a diary card&#xD;
      for 7 days after each dose. Safety and laboratory tests and physical exams will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and saliva samples be collected to assess the immune response from the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim report based on the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine (BBV154) will be&#xD;
      notified to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), India, for further&#xD;
      progressing the clinical development of the vaccine. This unblinded interim report will&#xD;
      contain a detailed analysis of the data based on the primary and secondary objectives of all&#xD;
      visits through Day 42 (Immunogenicity &amp; Safety).&#xD;

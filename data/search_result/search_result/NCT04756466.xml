  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the consumption of a probiotic&#xD;
      strain on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in the internal elderly population in a&#xD;
      residence for the elderly.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The working hypothesis is that the administration of a Lactobacillus strain improves the&#xD;
      immune response of the elderly, helping them to respond better to a possible COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. The strain would act as an adjuvant that contributes to developing an effective&#xD;
      response against the virus, and therefore there are fewer infectious symptoms due to this&#xD;
      virus or, if it appears, it occurs in a milder way among the subjects who take the probiotic&#xD;
      strain. This strategy would be of special interest in elderly residents in nursing homes in&#xD;
      which due to their greater susceptibility there is a greater risk of contagion sources, as&#xD;
      seen in the wave of infections that occurred in the weeks of March and April in Spain.&#xD;

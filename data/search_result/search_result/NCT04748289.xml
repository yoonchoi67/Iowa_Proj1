  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In neurocritical care, besides the standard intensive care monitoring, even more data are&#xD;
      obtained from the very complex pathophysiological changes in brain disease. Medical staff for&#xD;
      decision-making cannot integrate the huge amount of clinical data generated every second and&#xD;
      visualized on different monitors, anymore. Lack of data integration and usability is a major&#xD;
      reason that only few of the knowledge physicians use in this field is evidence based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early warning systems, powered by predictive algorithms that detect critical states before&#xD;
      they happen would allow the staï¬€ to intervene early and mitigate or even prevent such a&#xD;
      critical state.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2014, the project &quot;ICU-Cockpit&quot; has been set up at the Neurointensive Unit of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Zurich in collaboration with the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.&#xD;
      State-of-the-art information technology collects, synchronizes and encrypts data from&#xD;
      numerous medical devices in real time. The project is aimed at initiating a fundamental&#xD;
      development in emergency and intensive medicine - and bringing about a substantial&#xD;
      improvement in the way diagnostics, treatment and risk management are handled in everyday&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on video monitoring, algorithms for early alarm systems and therapy support have been&#xD;
      already developed. In order to make the algorithms usable for clinical practice, a user&#xD;
      interface (GUI) is currently being developed in cooperation with the University of Applied&#xD;
      Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), see appendix 15. The GUI allows to visualize and&#xD;
      interpret the multimodal patient data in a comprehensive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, a research project started at the NICU of the University Hospital Zurich started&#xD;
      with the title &quot;ICU Cockpit: Integrated platform for multimodal patient monitoring and&#xD;
      therapy support in neurocritical care&quot; (BASEC No. 2016-01101). The purpose of the single site&#xD;
      project is to set up an integrated platform (scientific prototype of ICU Cockpit software&#xD;
      platform) for multimodal patient monitoring and therapy support in neurocritical care, and as&#xD;
      a second step to develop and validate algorithms for some first clinical applications.&#xD;
      Furthermore, automatic artefacts detections (i.e., number of false and true alarms in ICU&#xD;
      Cockpit in comparison to standard monitoring system) are assessed and algorithms are&#xD;
      developed for the early detection of epileptic seizures and secondary impairment of cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this current clinical investigation is the verification and validation of&#xD;
      the ICU Cockpit software platform and the following three different applications for&#xD;
      prognostication and prediction of complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) ICU Cockpit COVID-19 for remote monitoring of isolated patients, b) ICU Cockpit Stable&#xD;
      State for a comprehensive visualization of vital parameters and as additional aid in early&#xD;
      detection of imminent critical complications c) ICU Cockpit Cerebral Ischemia for the&#xD;
      prediction of delayed cerebral ischemia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ICU Cockpit COVID-19 for remote monitoring of isolated patients Having infected more&#xD;
           than 100 000 people in 100 countries, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become&#xD;
           a pandemic. In China, up to 10% of patients with COVID-19 became severely ill requiring&#xD;
           intensive care treatment mostly due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
           (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. In Italy, having about 5200 beds in intensive care units&#xD;
           (ICUs), already 1028 were already devoted to patients with COVID-19 by March 11.&#xD;
           Furthermore, 20% of health-care professionals, at this time, have become already&#xD;
           infected, and some have died. For the United States, without self-isolation and for R0 =&#xD;
           2 and R0 = 2.5, respectively, ICU admissions are projected to become 17.4 to 25.7 per&#xD;
           1,000 population, which would significantly exceed the capacity of the existing 100,000&#xD;
           ICU beds in the US. Also, in Switzerland the health care system and especially ICUs are&#xD;
           facing extraordinary challenges as human resources for ICU professionals are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Advances in medical informatics have the potential to facilitate medical care and save&#xD;
           personnel resources not only in the ambulatory sector but in the ICUs especially during&#xD;
           epidemics. In intensive and emergency medicine, the situation is compounded by real-time&#xD;
           signals from multiple sensors on, as well as inside the human body. In an emergency&#xD;
           situation, in particular, it is not possible to integrate this flood of information&#xD;
           rapidly into the decision-making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Remote monitoring of strictly isolated patients especially reduces routes and walking of&#xD;
           the staff, the number of close contacts with infected patients and therefore, virus&#xD;
           transmission. The safety of patients will be increased by a reduction of stress and&#xD;
           burnouts in nurses and medical doctors, which often work in crisis over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ICU Cockpit Stable State As a first application a software called &quot;stable state&quot; has&#xD;
           been developed recently. Vital parameters as arterial blood pressure, intracranial&#xD;
           pressure and many others are hard to read in a glance due to their high information&#xD;
           density. Since the human body is a complexly inter-connected system, these biosignals&#xD;
           are also heavily correlated. Experienced clinicians can recognize deviations in the&#xD;
           correlational structure of several signals, but it is impossible to grasp the full&#xD;
           picture for the huge amount of available data. However, subtle correlational changes may&#xD;
           indicate an instable state of a patient before these changes are visible in a specific&#xD;
           signal or its compound measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An algorithm which computes the inter-dependencies in an arbitrary set of signals during&#xD;
           a stable phase of the patient was recently developed. This stable state is compared to&#xD;
           an on-line estimate of the current state. Correlational changes are didactically reduced&#xD;
           and visualized in a Mondrian-like display for quick comparisons of current and past&#xD;
           states.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The application &quot;stable state&quot; as part of the GUI ICU Cockpit is planned to be&#xD;
           implemented as an additional aid in early detection of imminent critical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ICU Cockpit Cerebral Ischemia Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is a delayed morphologic&#xD;
           narrowing of cerebral arteries, occurring 4 to 10 days after aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
           hemorrhage. Classically, CVS has been associated with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI),&#xD;
           which ultimately leads to cerebral infarction associated with morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
           This has been sort of a paradigm, and the term CVS has been often misused to describe&#xD;
           clinical signs of DCI. The majority of research was focused on the assumption CVS to be&#xD;
           solely responsible for DCI. Today, it is well accepted that not all patients with CVS&#xD;
           develop DCI. Inversely, DCI can occur in the absence of CVS. Recent review of the&#xD;
           literature indicates that CVS is not the only cause of DCI and that the entire picture&#xD;
           of DCI is multifactorial. There is an ongoing debate about this issue, however cerebral&#xD;
           infarction on imaging studies might be the most appropriate measure of DCI beside&#xD;
           functional outcome. Therefore, an algorithm to predict DCI based on a random forest&#xD;
           model has been developed, which allows to identify biomarkers for the occurrence 24h to&#xD;
           48 hours before.&#xD;

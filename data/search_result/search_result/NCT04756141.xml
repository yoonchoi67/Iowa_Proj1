  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if CGM (continuous glucose monitors) used in the&#xD;
      hospital in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes treated with insulin will be as accurate as&#xD;
      POC (point of care) glucose monitors. Also if found to be accurate, CGM reading data will be&#xD;
      used together with POC glucometers to dose insulin therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participation involves placement of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on the abdomen&#xD;
      of hospitalized patients who have a diagnosis of COVID19. The CGM will measure glucose levels&#xD;
      every 5 minutes which will be accessible for viewing using a receiver phone placed outside&#xD;
      the patient's room and/or an iPad located at the nursing station.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alarm limits for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be set on the receiver phone for nursing&#xD;
      staff to review. These alarms settings will vary depending on whether the patient is on IV&#xD;
      insulin infusion vs. subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. The number of glucose checks required with&#xD;
      these two types of insulin varies significantly and requires separate handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital glucometers will be used to confirm the accuracy of CGM readings during an initial&#xD;
      &quot;Adjustment Phase&quot; of the study. If CGMs are found to be accurate, then finger-stick&#xD;
      glucometer check frequency will be decreased, and some of the CGM values will be used to dose&#xD;
      insulin therapy during the &quot;Utilization Phase&quot; of the study. The instructions for these&#xD;
      phases will differ for patients on IV insulin infusion vs. SQ insulin infusion and are&#xD;
      detailed in separate protocols. Nursing staff will choose the appropriate protocol at the&#xD;
      time of CGM placement based on the type of insulin the patient is receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different patient variables (demographics, comorbidities, labs and vitals, administered&#xD;
      medications) will be collected from electronic health record and will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine if they interfere with CGM readings. At the time of discharge, patients will&#xD;
      receive a survey regarding satisfaction with the use of CGM monitors to manage their diabetes&#xD;
      during their inpatient stay.&#xD;

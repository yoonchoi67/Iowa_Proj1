      The purpose of this studdy is to assess the effectiveness of a telegeriatric intervention&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients were recruited from a cohort study in which the participants had previously&#xD;
      signed an informed consent in which they allowed contact to participate in new studies,&#xD;
      participants who met the inclusion criteria in the original database were recruited and&#xD;
      signed an electronic informed consent of the new study. A comprehensive geriatric assessment&#xD;
      was generated to assess whether they were candidates even due to changes in health status&#xD;
      that could change over time since their last assessment, they were recruited until the&#xD;
      expected sample size was obtained, and they were randomized, blinding the participants to&#xD;
      belong to the intervention group (individualized care: geriatrics, psychology, physical&#xD;
      activity and nutrition) or the control group (orientation in standardized health issues&#xD;
      through audiovisual educational material)&#xD;

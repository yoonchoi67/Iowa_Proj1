      The institutional review board approved this retrospective study at a public academic medical&#xD;
      center. The monthly volume of breast biopsies and breast cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      (between January 1 and July 31, 2020) was compared to the same period a year earlier&#xD;
      (pre-COVID-19).&#xD;

    <description>Patients receiving biopsies with a BI-RADS assessment of 4 or 5 from mammographic or ultrasonographic exams or combinations of tests were analyzed [4]. We further categorized the biopsy data as ultrasound-guided or mammograph-guided biopsy based on procedure coding. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed for breast lesions visible on ultrasound.</description>

        The test period of the COVID-19 pandemic was between January 1 and July 31, 2020. Moreover,&#xD;
        the control period of the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was between January 1 and July 31, 2019,&#xD;
        before there was any report about the virus. Only patients with complete medical records&#xD;
        were eligible for enrollment in this study. Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers in Taiwan were&#xD;
        acquired from Taiwan's National Health Command Center [7]. Anonymized records of breast&#xD;
        biopsies and cancer registration in a single institution in southern Taiwan in the&#xD;
        pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods were reviewed.&#xD;

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective treatment method for COVID-19 yet. With vaccination being the most&#xD;
      effective approach to control the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines have been developed with many&#xD;
      different methods. One of the vaccines developed, the China-based CoronaVac vaccine&#xD;
      (inactivated + aluminum adjuvant vaccine) is a vaccine developed with the inactive method,&#xD;
      which is the classical vaccine production method. As a result of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3&#xD;
      trials, emergency use approval has been given for the CoronaVac vaccine by Turkish&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. The clinical picture of COVID-19 can be&#xD;
      heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease, which can be associated with a&#xD;
      cytokine storm. In the clinical results of COVID-19, it has been observed that the severity&#xD;
      of the disease is lower in women than in men, and the mortality rates are lower in women than&#xD;
      in men. A few studies have shown the physiological roles of some vitamins and trace elements&#xD;
      in COVID-19. Investigation of free radical levels known to be effective in the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease due to oxidative stress is important in determining the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the social isolation&#xD;
      rules and quarantine measures applied in the COVID-19 pandemic have caused individuals to be&#xD;
      negatively affected physically and psychologically and their quality of life to decrease.&#xD;
      Investigating the changes in oxidative stress parameters, trace element and quality of life&#xD;
      levels of vaccination in COVID-19 may provide useful information in determining the effects&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccine. It is planned to include female individuals to be vaccinated in Izmir&#xD;
      Bakırcay University Cigli Training and Research Hospital. Within the scope of the study, it&#xD;
      was planned to determine the oxidative stress parameters, trace element levels and quality of&#xD;
      life levels of the individuals and to compare the values of the data obtained before and&#xD;
      after vaccination. After analyzing the data obtained from the research with appropriate&#xD;
      statistical methods, the data will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by a coronavirus strain that is a member of the&#xD;
      Betacoronavirus genus, affecting billions of people worldwide, has become a global health&#xD;
      problem. Since vaccination is the most effective approach to control the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      trials of many different vaccines have been started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the data of the World Health Organization, there are 236 vaccines in total, with&#xD;
      clinical (63) and pre-clinical (173) studies developed using 10 different methods.Types of&#xD;
      vaccines for COVID-19 include conventionally live attenuated viruses, inactivated virus&#xD;
      protein or polysaccharide conjugated subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), nucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA and RNA), viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating), and the other vaccines&#xD;
      composed of eccombinant proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CoronaVac vaccine (inactivated + aluminum adjuvant vaccine) is a vaccine developed by the&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical company named Sinovac Biotech Ltd. based in China, using the classical&#xD;
      vaccine production method (inactive method). After the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2&#xD;
      trials of the vaccine, Phase 3 trials were initiated in Turkey. Emergency use approval has&#xD;
      been given for the CoronaVac vaccine by Turkish Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency&#xD;
      after the end of these trials.Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood,&#xD;
      its clinical presentation may become heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that a systemic hyperinflammatory response and associated thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications are observed in cases with severe symptoms. In addition, it has been observed&#xD;
      that the severity of the disease and mortality rates are lower in women compared to men in&#xD;
      the clinical results of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The roles of vitamins A, B, C, D, E and folate and trace elements such as iron, zinc,&#xD;
      magnesium, selenium and copper in supporting the immune system have been shown to have&#xD;
      positive effects on COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediates in enzymatic reactions occurring during cell metabolism (reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species and reactive nitrogen) sometimes leak from the active site of enzymes and&#xD;
      accidentally interact with molecular oxygen and form free oxygen radicals. Oxidative stress&#xD;
      caused by free oxygen radicals forms the molecular basis in the development of cancer,&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social isolation rules and quarantine measures have negatively affected the daily lives of&#xD;
      individuals physically and psychologically. In particular, the increase in the time spent at&#xD;
      home causes individuals to have a sedentary life and cause their physical levels to decrease.&#xD;
      This situation caused individuals to be psychologically affected by concerns about health,&#xD;
      news watched, and the increasing number of cases day by day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also reported negative psychological effects such as post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      symptoms, confusion, disappointment, feeling of isolation and anger as a result of&#xD;
      quarantine. These psychological and physical effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic caused a&#xD;
      decrease in the quality of life of individuals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been&#xD;
      reported that the depression and anxiety levels of healthcare workers increased and their&#xD;
      quality of life decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare and determined and the changes of oxidative stress&#xD;
      parameters, trace element and quality of life levels in healthy women just before the first&#xD;
      dose of COVID-19 vaccine and on the 7th day after the second dose of COVID19 vaccine.&#xD;

The scale that patients can apply themselves and in a short time; It consists of 36 items and 8 subsections. These sections are physical functionality, social functionality, role restrictions due to physical problems, role restrictions due to emotional problems, pain, energy level / vitality / vitality, mental health, and general health perception (40). The last 4 weeks are considered in the evaluation of the scale. The scale gives a separate total score for each subsection. The points obtained from the subsections are not added up. Subdivisions rate health from 0 to 100. While it expresses bad health status as &quot;0 points&quot;, it refers to good health status as &quot;100 points&quot;.</description>

    <textblock>
      The investigators planned to examine a cohort of admitted patients at University of Chile&#xD;
      Clinical Hospital with COVID-19 diagnosis. Authors report data on mortality, ICU admission,&#xD;
      need of invasive mechanical ventilation, awake and ventilated prone positioning, use of High&#xD;
      Flow Nasal Cannula, Thromboembolic disease, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Renal Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy. Additionally, the risk of in-hospital death according to chronic disease burden and&#xD;
      severity of illness at admission was assessed.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study of adult inpatients at University of Chile Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital, located in Santiago, Chile. We enrolled all patients aged over 18 years detected&#xD;
      with COVID-19 admitted to the emergency department between March 1-June 11, 2020 through&#xD;
      prospective identification using daily admission records. Briefly, COVID-19 diagnosis was&#xD;
      made when patients had clinical findings of acute respiratory illness together with i) a&#xD;
      positive result on reverse transcriptase chain reaction polymerase (RT-PCR) assay performed&#xD;
      on a nasopharyngeal swab; and/or ii) chest computed tomography (CT) with typical findings of&#xD;
      COVID-19 and absence of an alternative diagnosis. We intended to include all admitted&#xD;
      patients during the first 100 days of the pandemic; therefore, no sample size calculation was&#xD;
      performed. We excluded patients with length of stay less than 24 hours, nosocomial SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection, and asymptomatic patients admitted for causes unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      regardless of their admission RT-PCR result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data were prospectively recorded for each included patient at admission and then daily&#xD;
      until the end of the follow-up. Records were consulted by trained physicians, using a&#xD;
      standardized data collection form, and then checked by a team of four physicians. Data&#xD;
      discrepancy was agreed between the same clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, disease onset time,&#xD;
      associated symptoms, vital signs at the emergency department, laboratory test performed&#xD;
      within 24 hours after admission, characteristics of the first chest CT, medication and&#xD;
      supportive care provided, and length of stay at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antibiotics, antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, advanced oxygen delivery&#xD;
      techniques, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), awake and ventilated prone&#xD;
      position, use of vasopressor drugs, and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) were&#xD;
      explicitly recorded. Clinical management and use of these therapies were based on national&#xD;
      recommendations from scientific societies and local protocols. Outcome collection and&#xD;
      assignment are explained below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made using RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs. All laboratory, microbiologic, and radiologic assessments were performed at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physicians who were encouraged to follow local clinical&#xD;
      guidelines. Film-array on the nasopharyngeal swab was performed for viral co-infection&#xD;
      assessment, and urinary antigens. (pneumococcal and legionella) and blood cultures were&#xD;
      performed for bacterial co-infection assessment. Chest radiographs and CT were also performed&#xD;
      for all inpatients by experienced radiologists and classified as COVID-19-unrelated, typical&#xD;
      or atypical pattern, and unspecified.&#xD;

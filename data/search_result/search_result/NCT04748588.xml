  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 is a frequent&#xD;
      concern across hospital settings in Canada and is associated with substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. This clinical trial is initially designed to evaluate the role of bamlanivimab, a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, for the treatment of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients who acquire COVID19 via nosocomial infection. New treatments, as they become&#xD;
      available, may be integrated, with appropriate adaptation of this document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that monoclonal antibody treatments are most likely to be effective early in&#xD;
      the disease course. The ability to rapidly identify and initiate such treatments in patients&#xD;
      with nosocomial acquisition of the infection, combined with the high mortality of 25-30%&#xD;
      experienced by this group of patients led us to propose this trial in collaboration with the&#xD;
      CATCO national network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      bamlanivimab relative to the control arm, in patients who develop nosocomial SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection, on need for mechanical ventilation or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a pragmatic randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care (control) or the study&#xD;
      medication on a 1:2 basis. Bamlanivimab will be administered intravenously as a one-time&#xD;
      infusion after randomization. Incidence of infusion-related reactions in the 24 hours post&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

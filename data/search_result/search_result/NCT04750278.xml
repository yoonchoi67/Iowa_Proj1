&#xD;
             Note: Corticosteroids that are being used for other indications are also allowed as&#xD;
             long as the daily prednisone (or other corticosteroid equivalent) dose is ≤ 10 mg.&#xD;
             Inhaled corticosteroids and nasal corticosteroids are also acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: As therapies for COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, other medications that may be&#xD;
             considered standard of care can be considered with prior approval from the Sponsor or&#xD;
             Medical Monitor.&#xD;

             interpretation of the study results or that would place the patient at undue risk by&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;

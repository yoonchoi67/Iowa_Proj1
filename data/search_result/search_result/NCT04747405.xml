  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological impact of intensive care hospitalization for patients has been demonstrated&#xD;
      during the last few years: anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
      Hospitalizations during COVID-19 pandemic have been marked by factors such as confinement&#xD;
      forbidding family members visits, stress on intensive care unit ...Those factors may have a&#xD;
      psychological impact added to factors of long hospitalization and prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons the investigators fear that patients hospitalized in intensive care&#xD;
      during COVID-19 pandemic develop psychological trouble with an increased risk for those who&#xD;
      experienced COVID-19 infection. The hypothesis therapy group added to standard care might&#xD;
      have a positive impact on psychological troubles such as anxiety, depression and post&#xD;
      traumatic stress disorder for patients who have been hospitalized in intensive care during&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group receiving standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group receiving standard of care and therapy group&#xD;

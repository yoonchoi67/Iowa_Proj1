  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective physiologic study, in participants with COVID-19-related pneumonia requiring&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen (standard oxygen therapy or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)) less than 24&#xD;
      hours. The investigators assessed the effect of prone position on ventilation inhomogeneity&#xD;
      and ventilation/perfusion mismatch by electrical impedance tomography (EIT).&#xD;

      Once enrolled, an EIT dedicated belt containing 16 electrodes was placed around the&#xD;
      participant's chest at the fifth or sixth intercostal space and connected it to an EIT&#xD;
      monitor (PulmoVista 500; Dräger Medical GmbH, Lübeck, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data were collected during supine position (timepoint SP1), including demographic&#xD;
      and anthropometric data, a baseline arterial blood gas measurement, and ventilation&#xD;
      parameters including type of supplemental oxygen, respiratory rate, fractional concentration&#xD;
      of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2). The participants received instructions of end expiratory&#xD;
      occlusion lasting at least 10 seconds and, 1 seconds after the start, a bolus of 10 mL of 5%&#xD;
      NaCl solution was injected via the central venous catheter. Subsequently, each participant&#xD;
      was helped into the prone position and data collection，end expiratory occlusion and 5% NaCl&#xD;
      solution injection were preformed again after approximately 30 min (timepoint PP1). The&#xD;
      participant was then encouraged to maintain the prone position for at least 3 h before being&#xD;
      helped back into the supine position. Clinical data collection, end expiratory occlusion and&#xD;
      injection of a bolus of 10 mL of 5% NaCl solution were repeated again 1 h after resupination&#xD;
      (timepoint SP2).&#xD;

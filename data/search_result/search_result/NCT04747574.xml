  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study, three dose escalation groups, to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      CD24-exosomes in patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 infection and factors predictive of a cytokine storm&#xD;
      are recruited from the Corona department of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC), who&#xD;
      have provided informed consent are being recruited in three dose groups who will receive the&#xD;
      exosome treatment as an add-on treatment to standard treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible disease in the community. The&#xD;
      main cause of clinical deterioration that leads to death is the cytokine storm in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD24 is a small heavily glycosylated GPI-anchored protein. CD24 is a key player in the vast&#xD;
      majority of human cancers and also plays an important role in controlling the homeostatic&#xD;
      proliferation of T cells. Hence, CD24 can negatively regulate inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is a biologic therapeutic agent based on exosomes carrying CD24. The rationale&#xD;
      for this treatment is that exosomes overexpressing CD24, isolated and purified from&#xD;
      T-REx™-293 cells engineered to express CD24 at high levels, can suppress the cytokine storm&#xD;
      and are delivered directly to the target organ using exosomes as a highly body-compatible&#xD;
      delivery vehicle. This enables a strong reduction of the required dose (as opposed to&#xD;
      systemic administration), and reduces the risk for adverse events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to identify patients with GU disease with active or&#xD;
      past COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete an Online COVID-19 Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disclose if the patient has or had Genitourinary cancer or benign urologic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide urine specimen for research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide 4 tablespoons of blood for testing blood for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide permission to access medical records, such as patient lab results, medical&#xD;
           history, imaging reports, etc.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has a higher incidence in males compared to females and cancer patients have a&#xD;
      higher risk of contracting COVID-19, and developing complications, and deteriorate more&#xD;
      rapidly. COVID19 pandemic poses significant challenges in clinical decision-making, which has&#xD;
      impacted management of GU patients. In order to mitigate the risk associated with COVID19&#xD;
      pandemic while also providing the best clinical care for patients a screening approach is&#xD;
      essential. Clinicians taking care of cancer patients will be expected not only to understand&#xD;
      impact of COVID19 but also incorporate a triage tool to decide which patients need immediate&#xD;
      treatment. This prospective study presented in this IRB is about establishing a screening&#xD;
      tool for GU patients with pre-existing cancer or with benign urological disease (e.g. BPH,&#xD;
      kidney stone, bladder infection, urinary tract infections etc) and for those who are dealing&#xD;
      with decisions for biopsy, active surveillance, surgery, radiation, hormonal and&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team is expecting to enroll 15240 subjects under this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures involved in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consenting patients for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening/Baseline REDCap survey to determine their COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood sample collection: This will be obtained for research studies including immune&#xD;
           monitoring assays&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Urine sample collection for bio-marker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data collection from medical records, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical diagnoses, including date of confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any pertinent medical history, including concomitant medications, and comorbidities&#xD;
                that pre- date enrollment in the study, or that occur during enrollment in the&#xD;
                study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory values from time of blood procurement&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All imaging (X-ray, MRI, CAT, PAT, PSMA, Ultrasound, and Pathology etc.) performed&#xD;
                from time of initial diagnosis until death, and any needed imaging that pre- date&#xD;
                enrollment that may serve as a comparative to pre/post treatment imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection time of samples in relation to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  REDCap questionnaire, COVID-19 symptoms and severity of the symptoms&#xD;

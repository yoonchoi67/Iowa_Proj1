  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection is currently confirmed by a complex, multiple-step procedure starting with&#xD;
      a mucosal swab, followed by viral RNA extraction and processing and qPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to explore a novel method using machine learning and artificial intelligence&#xD;
      (AI) algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 infection through the morphological analysis of&#xD;
      lymphocyte subset in the peripheral blood. Our study will also risk stratify patients with&#xD;
      COVID 19 infection based on the above finding along with other clinical, haematological and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters with a view to predict their clinical outcome with high sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity.&#xD;

      This is an observational study which will be carried out at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust (ESNEFT) in collaboration with University of Suffolk (UoS). This research&#xD;
      study is being led by the Haematology Clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to analyse subsets of lymphocytes in the prospective blood smear slides using machine&#xD;
      learning and AI algorithm obtained from patients with a positive qPCR test for COVID-19 who&#xD;
      have required a hospital admission. The control group will consist of archived blood smear&#xD;
      slide data from patients both with i) non-suspected viral infections, and ii) those with a&#xD;
      non-COVID-19 viral infection obtained prior to the emergence of COVID-19 infection in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom. In total, 785 blood smear slides will be analysed. The aim of our study is to&#xD;
      establish the diagnosis of COVID 19 infection based on lymphocyte morphology on patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection from other patients with non COVID -19 viral infections. A high definition&#xD;
      single cell lymphocyte image from patients with COVID 19 infection and control group will be&#xD;
      analysed using open source histopathology imaging software CellProfiler against very fine&#xD;
      cytoplasmic and nuclear details of the cells through supervised and unsupervised machine&#xD;
      learning algorithm to identify recurring pattern that is unique to COVID 19 infection. The&#xD;
      study will also assess other relevant clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters in&#xD;
      conjunction with the above morphological features to develop a risk stratification tool to&#xD;
      predict the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 infection with high specificity and&#xD;
      sensitivity using bioinformatics pipeline.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of the study will be to evaluate whether the detailed morphological analysis of the lymphocytes alone with no additional tests can confidently and rapidly diagnose COVID-19 disease with high specificity and sensitivity, using AI-based image analytical modelling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk stratification modelling</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure of the study will be to create risk stratification modelling, to aid in predicting the severity and mortality of the infection, based on our above-mentioned, novel diagnostic tool and additional clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters; ensuring high specificity, with consequent facilitated management of patients both in a hospital and outpatient setting. The model proposed intends to use and evaluate the clinical parameters including oxygen saturation at the time of venesection, and other vital statistics, including: pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate, along with other parameters such as LDH, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimers, renal function, all together helping to predict disease outcome and severity.</description>

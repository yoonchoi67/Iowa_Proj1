  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 pandemic has affected global health systems and required healthcare&#xD;
      professionals to show high performance. In this process, the mental health of intensive care&#xD;
      nurses, who undertake the biggest burden in health systems, is negatively affected by the&#xD;
      high working hours and patient care burden during the pandemic. When the literature is&#xD;
      reviewed, pessimistic thinking, feeling hopeless and not enjoying life at more exacerbated&#xD;
      levels can be observed in intensive care nurses. It is concluded that studies are needed to&#xD;
      increase the motivation of intensive care nurses during the Covid-19 pandemic.In this study,&#xD;
      it was aimed to evaluate the effect of motivational messages on optimism, hopelessness and&#xD;
      life satisfaction of intensive care nurses during the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;

      In this study, investigators try to estimate Covid-19 Cases and Deaths using countrywide&#xD;
      annual macro-scale indicators (i.e., estimators) such as non-communicable disease data from&#xD;
      WHO (who. int), social and economical indicators from UN (un.org) and Worldbank&#xD;
      (worldbank.org), and Covid-19 Cases and Deaths from Worldometer&#xD;
      (https://www.worldometers.info).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are some known risk factors for the emergence and mortality of Covid-19 cases. There&#xD;
      are also some regulations and recommendations by healthcare executives and government&#xD;
      officers such as wearing masks, social distance, staying at home, lockdowns, and so forth. On&#xD;
      the other hand, there could be other social, economic, and health-related factors in the&#xD;
      society level that discriminate between countries significantly in terms of having&#xD;
      considerable differences regarding both the frequency and mortality of Covid-19. The aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to find out these social, economic, and health-related factors that&#xD;
      could explain some significant portion of Covid-19 cases and deaths worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves 171 countries of which required datasets are commonly available in the&#xD;
      UN, Worldometer, and WHO. The investigators will obtain macro-scale indicators like&#xD;
      non-communicable disease data from WHO (who. int), social and economical indicators from UN&#xD;
      (un.org) and Worldbank (worldbank.org), and Covid-19 data from Worldometer&#xD;
      (https://www.worldometers.info).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct statistical data analysis and create predictive models in&#xD;
      order to determine indicators. The investigators will also consider that possible different&#xD;
      models for explaining Covid-19 Cases and mortality in both common and different estimators&#xD;
      could explain the variations in countrywide deaths and cases.&#xD;

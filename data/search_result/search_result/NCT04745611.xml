  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is known to affect the respiratory system but may also have an impact on other organ&#xD;
      systems, including the brain. A number of severely ill patients also presents neurological&#xD;
      symptoms that may be the result of COVID-19 associated brain damage. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the presence, type, and severity of brain damage as well as the neurological&#xD;
      and neuropsychological sequelae of COVID-19 infection. Further, the impact of this infection&#xD;
      on daily life functioning, quality of life, and the emotional well-being of family members&#xD;
      will be assessed. In this multicenter study, 6-9 months after hospital discharge patients&#xD;
      will undergo a 3-T MRI scan and a neuropsychological examination. Additionally, both patients&#xD;
      and their family members will answer several questionnaires at 6- 9 and 12-15 months after&#xD;
      hospital discharge. COVID-19 patients previously admitted to a general hospital ward will be&#xD;
      compared with patients previously admitted to the intensive-care unit. The proposed study&#xD;
      will create a more comprehensive picture of the prolonged COVID-19 effects on the brain,&#xD;
      mental, and cognitive well-being. The findings will aid patient care and rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory&#xD;
      system. However, in severely ill patients damage is also reported to other organ systems&#xD;
      including the heart, the kidneys, the circulatory, and gastrointestinal system. Further,&#xD;
      research indicates an impact of the virus on the brain and, thereby, on cognition. Patients&#xD;
      experience neurological symptoms, MR imaging implies the presence of brain abnormalities,&#xD;
      specifically in severely ill patients and studies on cognition suggest problems with memory,&#xD;
      attention, information processing and executive function. Preliminary clinical data also show&#xD;
      that COVID-19 is associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain damage and therefrom resulting emotional and cognitive deficits in ICU-treated patients&#xD;
      are not uncommon findings. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) summarizes physical,&#xD;
      cognitive, and mental impairments associated with ICU admission. PICS is assumed to be&#xD;
      induced by a combination of patient-specific (e.g., psychiatric history), disease-related&#xD;
      (e.g., hypoxemia), and ICU factors (e.g., invasive procedures). These factors can cause a&#xD;
      variety of pathophysiologic states including atrophy, encephalopathy, and neuropathy,&#xD;
      eventually leading to impairment and reduced quality of life. Additionally, ICU-admission has&#xD;
      been found to also affect the mental health of patients´ family members (PICS-F). Many of&#xD;
      these PICS-inducing factors can be assumed to occur during severe COVID-19 illness and&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, it is likely that COVID-19 patients and their family members exhibit&#xD;
      PICS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, it is not known to what extend COVID-19 related brain injury and therewith&#xD;
      associated symptoms are present after the (sub)acute stages of illness and whether this will&#xD;
      lead to long-term deficits in function. Further, it is to be determined whether COVID-19&#xD;
      patients develop PICS syndrome and if so, whether the therewith associated symptoms are&#xD;
      limited to ICU-treated patients or may generally affect the broader group of hospitalized&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to fill these gaps in research through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) the identification of COVID-19 related brain abnormalities, cognitive impairments, and&#xD;
      emotional deficits after the (sub)acute stages of illness (i.e., 6-9 months post-hospital&#xD;
      discharge), 2) a comparison of COVID-19 related brain abnormalities, cognitive impairments,&#xD;
      and emotional deficits to historical PICS cohorts 3) a comparison between COVID-19 ICU&#xD;
      survivors and COVID-19 non-ICU patients in order to assess a potential PICS gradient and 3) a&#xD;
      follow-up examination of the aforementioned groups 6 months after the first assessment to&#xD;
      gain insight into the persistence of deficits.&#xD;

        individual that plays the most significant role in the patient´s life. The patient will&#xD;
        decide who this family member is. We will check the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Requires participation of the aforementioned family member as COVID-19 patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  objectified cognitive impairments before the hospital admission for the COVID-19&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an unexpected incident leading to severe neurological damage occurring after hospital&#xD;
             discharge (such as stroke or traumatic brain injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  contra-indications for MRI scanning (e.g. metal implants, cardiac pacemaker,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, pregnancy).&#xD;

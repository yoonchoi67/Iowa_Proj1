  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of containment due to Covid-19, the French High Authority for Health (HAS)&#xD;
      recommended reinforced monitoring of patients taken in care in the psychiatric ward, with&#xD;
      special attention for people over the age of 65. To meet this recommendation, the geriatrics&#xD;
      department of the hospital of Charity of Saint-Etienne hospital and the Vinatier hospital in&#xD;
      Lyon organized follow-up of these patients by telephone throughout the containment period,&#xD;
      thus allowing continuity of care. This pandemic situation and these measures are&#xD;
      unprecedented; it is difficult to anticipate the psychological impact on patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate if the type of coping strategies usually&#xD;
      employed has an effect on the outbreak of a post-traumatic stress after containment. In&#xD;
      addition, a second part of the study will propose to assess the factors influencing the&#xD;
      experience of containment such as personality, attachment style or coping strategies.&#xD;

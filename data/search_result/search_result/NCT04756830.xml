      This is an open-label uncontrolled study in which all participants will receive two doses of&#xD;
      the inactivated adsorbed vaccine against COVID-19, and will be followed up for safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity analysis for 24 months. This study will assess safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      the inactivated vaccine adsorbed against COVID-19 (CoronaVac) in a population of healthy&#xD;
      individuals older than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated number of participants is 1200. Participants will be recruited within 3-4&#xD;
      months. The total duration of the study is estimated to be 30 months after recruitment&#xD;
      begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will remain in the study for approximately 24 months. The study will be&#xD;
      carried out at the clinical research center of the D'Or Institute for Research and Education&#xD;
      (IDOR) located at the Hospital Glória D'Or, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of uncontrolled neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease,&#xD;
             according to anamnesis or physical examination. Significant changes in treatment or&#xD;

             indicators of uncontrolled disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases with impaired immune system including: neoplasms (except basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma), congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases not&#xD;
             controlled according to anamnesis or physical examination. Significant changes in&#xD;
             treatment or hospitalizations due to worsening of the condition in the last three&#xD;
             months are indicators of uncontrolled disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Behavioral, cognitive or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or his medical representative, affects the participant's ability to&#xD;
             understand and collaborate with the requirements of the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any alcohol or drug abuse in the last 12 months prior to inclusion in the study that&#xD;

             participation in another clinical trial in the two years following inclusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in a COVID-19 vaccine evaluation study or previous exposure to&#xD;

             scheduled use within two years of inclusion. Immunosuppressive therapies will be&#xD;
             considered: antineoplastic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunosuppressants to&#xD;
             induce tolerance to transplants, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids in the last three months&#xD;

             dose of corticosteroids considered immunosuppressive is equivalent to prednisone at a&#xD;
             dose of 20 mg / day for adults, for more than a week. The continuous use of topical or&#xD;
             nasal corticosteroids is not considered immunosuppressive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received blood products (transfusions or immunoglobulins) in the last three&#xD;
             months before inclusion in the study, or scheduled administration of blood products or&#xD;

             postponed until the participant completes 72 hours without symptoms or the diagnosis&#xD;
             is ruled out);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received vaccine with live attenuated virus in the last 28 days or inactivated&#xD;
             vaccine in the last 14 days prior to their inclusion in the study, or have&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding disorders (for example, deficiency of clotting factors,&#xD;
             coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction), or previous history of bleeding or significant&#xD;
             bruising after IM injection or venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator or his medical&#xD;

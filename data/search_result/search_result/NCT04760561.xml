  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still on a rising course making&#xD;
      a great stress on medical resources throughout the world. Although most of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      require non-invasive oxygenation and ventilation, rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory&#xD;
      failure and then acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in some COVID19&#xD;
      patients due to prolonged or unaddressed hypoxia. Prone positioning is a common supportive&#xD;
      ventilation strategy to improve oxygenation in critically ill patients with ARDS. Recent&#xD;
      studies point out the potential benefits of using this strategy for non-intubated awake COVID&#xD;
      19 patients who are hypoxic. Despite several retrospective cohort studies have been conducted&#xD;
      to identify impact of the prone positioning in awake non-intubated COVID-19 patients,&#xD;
      experimental studies are very rare. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      self-prone positioning on oxygenation and physiological outcomes among awake-non intubated&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi experimental research design will be adopted to achieve the aim of the current study.&#xD;
      In this study 82 adult patients of either sex with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be&#xD;
      recruited from general intensive care unit of the chest hospital (affiliated to the Ministry&#xD;
      of Health) in Damanhour city, El Beheira Governorate, Egypt. Patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      current study if they meet study inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible patients will be randomly assigned into two groups (control and intervention&#xD;
      group) 41 patients in each. The control group will receive the standard management of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients according to the Egyptian Ministry of health guidelines. The standard&#xD;
      management includes supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP), antivirals, antibiotics, anticoagulants and glucocorticoids, as necessary, based on&#xD;
      the patients' clinical condition. Patients in the control group will be subjected to the&#xD;
      conventional positioning interventions provided by the critical care nurses, which will not&#xD;
      include self-prone positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive self-prone positioning and standard&#xD;
      management of COVID-19 patients. All patients in both groups (control and intervention) will&#xD;
      be monitored continuously by cardiac monitoring with oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the&#xD;
      study period. The demographic and baseline clinical data of all eligible patients will&#xD;
      collected and recorded using the study tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient in the intervention group will be helped into the prone position and encouraged&#xD;
      to stay in the prone position as long as tolerated (at least 1 hour). The prone positioning&#xD;
      consists of placing the patient on his or her stomach with the head on the side. Self-prone&#xD;
      position will be performed 45 minutes up to 1 hour after meals to avoid gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects. The patient will be maintained in prone position until the patient becomes too tired&#xD;
      and uncomfortable to keep that position. If patients will asked to regain the supine position&#xD;
      before the 1 hour period was complete, patient's prone position will be considered unfeasible&#xD;
      and the reason will be reported. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation at any&#xD;
      time point will be intubated and excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of patients' positioning on oxygenation and physiological parameters will be&#xD;
      collected and recorded. These parameters include vital signs (respiratory rate, systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate), SpO2, oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      ratio), ROX index (combination of the ratio of oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry&#xD;
      to fraction of inspired oxygen and respiratory rate [SpO2/FiO2]/respiratory rate) and&#xD;
      arterial blood gases parameters (pH, PaO2mmHg, PaCO2mmHg and SaO2). These parameters will be&#xD;
      recorded before and after positioning (immediately before, after 10 minutes and after 1hour).&#xD;
      Data of secondary outcomes of self-prone positioning will also be collected and recorded.&#xD;

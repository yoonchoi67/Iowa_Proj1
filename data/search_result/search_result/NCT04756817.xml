  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-world evidence confirming the effectiveness and safety of the new COVID-19 vaccines&#xD;
      among the elderly is currently lacking. However, scarce (sparse) data derived from phase&#xD;
      II/III trials attest to a weaker humoral immune response generated post-immunization among&#xD;
      seniors, in contrast to younger adults. According to the national priority vaccination scheme&#xD;
      the age group of 85 and older was the first to receive the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in&#xD;
      Greece. The aim of the study is to enhance our insight into the humoral immunity and antibody&#xD;
      generation elicited by the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine among the elderly. The study&#xD;
      population will include people aged 85 or older who are either uninfected or have a positive&#xD;
      history of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring one to 4.5 months prior to&#xD;
      vaccination. Upon receipt of informed consent, a cohort of persons vaccinated in the two&#xD;
      vaccination centers of the &quot;G. Gennimatas&quot; General Hospital of Thessaloniki will be followed&#xD;
      over a period of six months post-injection of the second dose. To monitor the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay will be applied to&#xD;
      conduct both qualitative and quantitative determination of IgGs against the receptor-binding&#xD;
      domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on day 21 after the first&#xD;
      dose, day 21 after the second dose and within 3 and 6 months after the second dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Real world data regarding the effectiveness and safety of the new COVID-19 vaccines in older&#xD;
      people are currently lacking. The sparse data from Phase II/II trials suggest a reduction in&#xD;
      antibody responses in older people compared to younger participants. The over-85 age group&#xD;
      was the first group to receive the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in Greece according to the&#xD;
      national priority vaccination scheme. The aim of the study is to enhance insight into the&#xD;
      immunity and antibody generation elicited by the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine among elderly&#xD;
      people over age 85. The study population will include both uninfected vaccinated persons and&#xD;
      persons with PCR-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring one to 4.5 months prior to&#xD;
      vaccination. After informed consent a cohort of persons vaccinated in the two vaccination&#xD;
      centers of the &quot;G. Gennimatas&quot; General Hospital of Thessaloniki will be followed for six&#xD;
      months post-second dose injection. The immunogenicity of the vaccine will be measured using&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay to conduct a qualitative and quantitative determination of&#xD;
      IgGs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike&#xD;
      protein on day 21 after the first dose, day 21 after the second dose and within 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having set the positivity threshold of the immunoassay (50 AU/ml) as a cut-off point,&#xD;
      participants will be classified both by history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and by SARSCoV-2&#xD;
      IgG II Quant assay outcomes. Subsequently, the IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC) and its&#xD;
      95% Confidence Interval will be calculated, based on the recorded antibody concentration&#xD;
      values. Regarding the reactogenicity of the vaccine, on the day of blood collection the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to report their experienced side effects. Of note, participants&#xD;
      are asked to officially report all unsolicited adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the National&#xD;
      Medicines Organization via the Yellow Card scheme. The study protocol has been endorsed and&#xD;
      ethical approval was obtained by the ethics committee of the scientific council of the &quot;G.&#xD;
      Gennimatas&quot; General Hospital (protocol number:2/12.02.2021).&#xD;

      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas, most commonly caused by&#xD;
      gallstones, or excessive use of alcohol. It represents a management challenge and a&#xD;
      significant healthcare burden. The incidence of AP ranges globally from 5 to 30 cases per&#xD;
      100.000 inhabitants/year, and there is evidence that the incidence has been rising in recent&#xD;
      years. The overall case fatality rate for AP is roughly 5%, and it is expectedly higher for&#xD;
      more severe stages of the disease [1, 2]. In most cases (80%), the outcome of AP is rapidly&#xD;
      favorable [3]. However, acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) may develop in up to 20% of&#xD;
      cases, and is associated with significant rates of early organ failure (38%), needing some&#xD;
      type of surgical/endoscopic intervention (38%) and death (15%) [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, AP is a leading cause of inpatient care among gastrointestinal&#xD;
      conditions: more than 270.000 patients are hospitalized for AP annually, at an aggregate cost&#xD;
      of over 2.5 billion dollars per year [5]. In Europe, the UK incidence of AP is estimated as&#xD;
      15-42 cases per 100.000/year and is rising by 2.7% each year [6].Despite existing&#xD;
      evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of biliary AP, clinical compliance with&#xD;
      recommendations is poor, with studies on this field identifying major discrepancies between&#xD;
      evidence-based recommendations and daily clinical practice. Audits about biliary AP have been&#xD;
      performed in Italy, Germany, France, and England, with quite disappointing results [8-11].&#xD;
      Indeed, in these audits, the treatment of biliary AP differed substantially from the&#xD;
      recommendations. For example, less than 15% of the responders stated that they strictly&#xD;
      followed all recommendations included in the guidelines in Germany and 25.8% of patients did&#xD;
      not receive definitive treatment for biliary AP within 1 year in the UK [12]. These findings&#xD;
      support the view that publication alone of nationally or internationally developed and&#xD;
      approved guidelines is insufficient to modify the practice of non-specialists and raises the&#xD;
      question of how best to spread guideline recommendations. Also, in 2020, the spread of the&#xD;
      virus Covid-19 has represented a pandemic that also had a profound impact on the surgical&#xD;
      community. There are many ways through which the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic could have&#xD;
      influenced daily clinical practice for patients with biliary AP also leading to a failure to&#xD;
      adhere to the recommendations coming from the guidelines, especially those regarding the&#xD;
      early and definitive treatment with cholecystectomy or ERCP and sphincterotomy. First of all,&#xD;
      the recommendation to postpone all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the&#xD;
      pandemic. Second, the recommendation to conservatively treat inflammatory conditions such as&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis wherever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the clinical compliance with recommendations about AP is poor and the impact of&#xD;
      implementing guideline recommendations in biliary AP has not been well studied on a global&#xD;
      basis, we launched the MANCTRA-1 study with the aim to demonstrate areas where there is&#xD;
      currently a sub-optimal implementation of contemporary guidelines on biliary AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we argue that during the Covid-19 pandemic the tendency to disregard the guidelines&#xD;
      recommendations has been more marked than usual and we will try to find out if AP patients'&#xD;
      care during the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a higher rate of adverse outcomes compared to&#xD;
      non-pandemic times due to the lack in the compliance of the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MANCTRA-1 can identify a number of areas for quality improvement that will require new&#xD;
      implementation strategies. Our aim is to summarize the main areas of sub-optimal care to&#xD;
      provide the basis for introducing a number of bundles in the management of AP patients to be&#xD;
      implemented during the next years.&#xD;

      Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas, most commonly&#xD;
      caused by gallstones, or excessive use of alcohol. It represents a management challenge and a&#xD;
      significant healthcare burden. The incidence of AP ranges globally from 5 to 30 cases per&#xD;
      100.000 inhabitants/year, and there is evidence that the incidence has been rising in recent&#xD;
      years. The overall case-fatality rate for AP is roughly 5%, and it is expectedly higher for&#xD;
      more severe stages of the disease [1-2]. In most cases (80%), the outcome of AP is rapidly&#xD;
      favorable [3]. However, acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) may develop in up to 20% of&#xD;
      cases, and is associated with significant rates of early organ failure (38%), needing some&#xD;
      type of surgical/endoscopic intervention (38%) and death (15%) [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, AP is a leading cause of inpatient care among gastrointestinal&#xD;
      conditions: more than 270.000 patients are hospitalized for AP annually, at an aggregate cost&#xD;
      of over 2.5 billion dollars per year [5]. In Europe, the UK incidence of AP is estimated as&#xD;
      15-42 cases per 100.000/year and is rising by 2.7% each year [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several scientific societies published their clinical practice guidelines making&#xD;
      recommendations on the management of AP. In 2019, the World Society of Emergency Surgery&#xD;
      (WSES) released the international guidelines for the management of severe AP [7]. The main&#xD;
      topics of these guidelines are the diagnosis, antibiotic treatment, management in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, surgical and operative management, and open abdomen management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite existing evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of biliary AP,&#xD;
      clinical compliance with recommendations is poor, with studies on this field identifying&#xD;
      major discrepancies between evidence-based recommendations and daily clinical practice.&#xD;
      Audits about biliary AP have been performed in Italy, Germany, France, and England, with&#xD;
      quite disappointing results [8-11]. Indeed, in these audits, the treatment of biliary AP&#xD;
      differed substantially from the recommendations. For example, less than 15% of the responders&#xD;
      stated that they strictly followed all recommendations included in the guidelines in Germany&#xD;
      and 25.8% of patients did not receive definitive treatment for biliary AP within 1 year in&#xD;
      the UK [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study from Singapore aiming to review the clinical management of patients with AP in&#xD;
      an HPB referral center in the light of assessing the compliance to the 2013 International&#xD;
      Association of Pancreatology (IAP)/American Pancreatic Association (APA) and the 2015&#xD;
      Japanese guidelines found that only 50% of patients received Ringer lactate for initial fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation, 38.7% received antibiotics as prophylaxis, 21.4% of patients with severe AP&#xD;
      had early enteral nutrition, and only 21.4% patients with biliary AP had index admission&#xD;
      cholecystectomy despite the recommendations [13]. In another recent study by a Canadian&#xD;
      group, only 25% of patients with gallstones AP underwent a cholecystectomy on the same&#xD;
      admission. Furthermore, only one-quarter of patients in whom an index admission&#xD;
      cholecystectomy was not possible underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy, and only one-third of&#xD;
      patients with gallstones AP and an imaging-confirmed obstructed common bile duct had an ERCP&#xD;
      and sphincterotomy [14]. Slow implementation of the recommendation on early cholecystectomy&#xD;
      has been reported also in a Danish survey seeking compliance with the recommendations of the&#xD;
      national reference program for treatment of patients with gallstone disease [15], and a&#xD;
      similar lack of compliance with guidelines was found in Italy, mainly regarding indications&#xD;
      for endoscopic and surgical management [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, a recent study from Sweden has shown that by improved compliance to current AP&#xD;
      guidelines, recurrence rate and associated costs can be reduced. The authors found that 80%&#xD;
      of patients with biliary AP underwent definitive treatment during their first attack (68%&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, 17% ERCP and sphincterotomy, 15% both interventions) [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, significant overall differences between the practice of HPB specialists and&#xD;
      non-specialists in gallstone AP have been reported, especially regarding severity assessment,&#xD;
      indication and timing of requesting CT scan, nutritional support, and in common bile duct&#xD;
      assessment prior to cholecystectomy [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings support the view that publication alone of nationally or internationally&#xD;
      developed and approved guidelines is insufficient to modify the practice of non-specialists&#xD;
      and raises the question of how best to spread guideline recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection of pancreatic necrosis is the predominant driver of sustained morbidity and late&#xD;
      mortality in patients with severe AP. The subset of patients with ANP may face a complex and&#xD;
      prolonged clinical course, with an associated mortality of up to 30% if an infection develops&#xD;
      in the necrotic collection [19, 20]. Optimal management of patients with pancreatic necrosis&#xD;
      requires a multidisciplinary approach, and specific guidelines for this specific subgroup of&#xD;
      patients have been recently released. Although antibiotic prophylaxis may prevent or reduce&#xD;
      colonization of necrosis, the results of RCTs evaluating this approach and meta-analyses do&#xD;
      not support prophylaxis [21]. Consequently, internationally applicable recommendations are&#xD;
      that intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of infectious&#xD;
      complications in AP. However, several global overviews assessing reports from across the&#xD;
      world of the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis in AP have shown a spread diffusion of such&#xD;
      behavior [22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2020, the spread of the virus Covid-19 has represented a pandemic that also had a profound&#xD;
      impact on the surgical community. The constant increase in the number of patients requiring&#xD;
      treatment has represented a huge challenge for the healthcare systems of many involved&#xD;
      countries and could be their breaking point. In an emergency situation, resources must be&#xD;
      concentrated and used rationally, both to handle the pandemic and to continue handling the&#xD;
      pre-existing diseases. In this context, the majority of surgical departments were forced to&#xD;
      re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent/emergent surgical cases and to&#xD;
      non-deferrable oncological cases. There are many ways through which the outbreak of the&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic could have influenced daily clinical practice for patients with biliary AP&#xD;
      also leading to a failure to adhere to the recommendations coming from the guidelines,&#xD;
      especially those regarding the early and definitive treatment with cholecystectomy or ERCP&#xD;
      and sphincterotomy. First of all, the recommendation to postpone all non-urgent endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures during the peak of the pandemic. Second, the recommendation to conservatively&#xD;
      treat inflammatory conditions such as acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis wherever&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study It is believed by many that clinical guidelines would help to&#xD;
      decrease inappropriate variation in practice, that they provide a rational basis for&#xD;
      referral, and that they would help to reduce uncertainty in the management of some&#xD;
      conditions. Clinical guidelines also provide a basis for continuing medical education and can&#xD;
      improve control of healthcare costs. However, the value of national and/or international&#xD;
      guidelines is very much dependent on a strategy for their implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although different guidelines for the management of biliary AP have been published, they have&#xD;
      not been properly investigated and compliance has generally been unsatisfactory. Deficiencies&#xD;
      and lack of standardization of the management of AP worldwide have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, previous reports, including the one from France in 2012 have shown that major&#xD;
      changes in biliary AP patients management were noticed since the publication of the French&#xD;
      guidelines. In particular, after the publication of the mentioned guidelines, lipase levels&#xD;
      were measured for establishing AP diagnosis by 99% (vs. 83% pre-guidelines) and a CT scan was&#xD;
      performed at 48h by 69% (vs. 29% pre-guidelines) to evaluate AP severity. Antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis and enteral nutrition were proposed by 20% (vs. 57% pre-guidelines) and 58% (vs.&#xD;
      25% pre-guidelines) for necrotizing AP [23].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly reported gaps between clinical practice and guidelines on AP include the&#xD;
      indications for CT scan, need and timing of artificial nutritional support, indications for&#xD;
      antibiotics, and surgical/endoscopic management of biliary AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study Since the clinical compliance with recommendations about AP is poor and the&#xD;
      impact of implementing guideline recommendations in biliary AP has not been well studied on a&#xD;
      global basis, we launched the MANCTRA-1 study with the aim to demonstrate areas where there&#xD;
      is currently a sub-optimal implementation of contemporary guidelines on biliary AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we argue that during the Covid-19 pandemic the tendency to disregard the guidelines&#xD;
      recommendations has been more marked than usual and we will try to find out if AP patients'&#xD;
      care during the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a higher rate of adverse outcomes compared to&#xD;
      non-pandemic times due to the lack in the compliance of the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MANCTRA-1 can identify a number of areas for quality improvement that will require new&#xD;
      implementation strategies. Our aim is to summarize the main areas of sub-optimal care to&#xD;
      provide the basis for introducing a number of bundles in the management of AP patients to be&#xD;
      implemented during the next years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All epidemiological, clinical, and surgical data will be collected on a CFR&#xD;
      that will be completed by accessing a protected data system. The link for accessing the&#xD;
      completion of the CFR will be sent via email to only one contact person (Local Lead) of each&#xD;
      participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Studies on biliary AP found a mortality rate of approximately 10%. Patients with&#xD;
      biliary AP tend to have higher mortality than patients with alcoholic pancreatitis. However,&#xD;
      this rate has been falling over the last 2 decades as improvements in supportive care have&#xD;
      been initiated. In patients with severe disease (organ failure), who account for about 20% of&#xD;
      presentations, mortality is approximately 30%. This rate has not decreased in the past 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that a minimum of 200 patients per group (2019 vs. 2020) would yield a power of&#xD;
      0.80 (1-ß) to establish whether changes in clinical care for patients with biliary AP during&#xD;
      the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted on overall mortality using a one-sided significance ɑ&#xD;
      level of 0.05 (5%) with power sample size calculator (sealedenvelope.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The dichotomous variables will be expressed as numbers and percentages,&#xD;
      while continuous variables will be expressed as mean and SD, or median and IQR (minimum and&#xD;
      maximum values). Student's t-test or ANOVA will be used for comparisons of continuous&#xD;
      variables between groups. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, will be&#xD;
      used for the analysis of categorical data. Multilogistic regression models will be used to&#xD;
      investigate clinical, laboratory, and radiologic variables predictive of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. A value of P &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;

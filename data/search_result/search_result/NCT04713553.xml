    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      vaccine candidate (BNT162b2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a 30-microgram dose, administered from 1 of 4 manufacturing lots (batches)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a 20-microgram dose, administered from 1 of the manufacturing lots&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In people 12 through 50 years of age&#xD;
